There comes a time in every touring band's life when one question must loom large: how do we get this golf buggy up the stairs?

Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals:  "The austerity that has been imposed on Wales has been crippling," he says. "It's been carried out by the Labour government in Cardiff and I've no idea why they've not been more vocal in being opposed to it. It'd be horrific for Wales if that continued. It's a lose-lose situation [whoever wins], but a Conservative and UKIP axis of evil running the country would be the nightmare scenario."

It's no surprise, then, that he sees some hope in the recent leaders' debates. While Scottish attention may have centred around Nicola Sturgeon's impressive showings, Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood also struck a chord, and Rhys was impressed by both.

"What's happened in Scotland seems very exciting and empowering, politically. On a political level it would be incredibly refreshing to see them [the SNP] have influence. I've really enjoyed the leaders debates, and seeing Leanne Wood, Nicola Sturgeon and Natalie Bennett talking a lot of sense and trying to break the neo-liberal stranglehold that's there...

"There's this idea that austerity is the only way, and it's constantly been drummed into people by the main parties that there is no alternative, and unfortunately it's been regurgitated by the media to the point that people believe the most important thing in life is paying off a debt, not treating your fellow humans with civility. It's been really heartening to see an alternative being offered in the debates."
