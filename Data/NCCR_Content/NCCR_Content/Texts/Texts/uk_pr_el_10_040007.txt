Press Release from Party: BNP

Hard Times on the Street of Shame
March 13, 2010

It is reported that Johnston Press, the publishers of regional newspapers which include the BNP-hostile Yorkshire Evening Post and the Scotsman, is to shed more jobs after a sharp drop in revenues.

The publisher claims that advertising revenues have fallen by a staggering 26.5%, whilst the groups total revenues plunged by a huge 20% to 428m last year.

The company has closed five of its regional titles over the last twelve months and lost almost 800 staff through retirement, natural wastage and compulsory and voluntary redundancies.

A spokesman for Johnston Press commented: With a lower revenue base we have to make sure that the cost structure of the base fits.

Now, partly as a result of the introduction of new technology, it is also  facing industrial action from unionised staff.

Meanwhile, over at Laboursupporting Trinity Mirror Group they are hoping for an end to job losses.

Last year alone Trinity Mirror was forced to close or sell 30 titles and cut its payroll by 1,700 employees in a bid to curtail its losses.

The group is reported to be in the process of acquiring another BNP-hostile title, the Manchester Evening News, from the Guardian Media Group; a purchase that will not be finalised until the end of the month.

Despite attempts to shore up the business, Trinity Mirrors share price on close of business yesterday was 166p  down from around 190p just six months ago.

It is not thought likely that the problems afflicting Britains struggling newspaper industry are likely to find much sympathy from amongst the mushrooming British Nationalist community; a community that has been misrepresented, insulted and libelled by this sordid and increasingly foreign-owned industry for decades.
