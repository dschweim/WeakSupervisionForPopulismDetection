Press Release from Party: LibDem

Business is being strangled by a lack of credit says Cable

Thu, 01 Apr 2010

Unless businesses can get the credit they need to create jobs and growth, there will be no recovery," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the Bank of Englands Credit Conditions survey which reveals lenders put the squeeze on small businesses during the first three months of the year, Vince Cable said:

Business is being strangled by a lack of credit.
 
For all the Chancellors tough talk about making banks lend, this is further proof that the Government is failing to ensure good British businesses get the money they need.
 
Unless businesses can get the credit they need to create jobs and growth, there will be no recovery.
 
The Government must take a firm hand with the banks which we own to ensure that they are lending to British businesses and supporting our economy.
