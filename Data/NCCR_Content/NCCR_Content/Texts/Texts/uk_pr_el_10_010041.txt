Press Release from Party: LibDem

Reoffending figures show billions are wasted creating more crime says Howarth

Thu, 18 Mar 2010

Prison clearly isnt working to reduce reoffending and yet all Labour and the Tories offer are threats to lock up more people," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Justice Secretary.

Commenting on Ministry of Justice figures showing nearly half all criminals released from prison go on to commit further offences, David Howarth said:

Prison clearly isnt working to reduce reoffending and yet all Labour and the Tories offer are threats to lock up more people.

Were throwing billions of pounds at something that is creating future crime.

We can cut crime if we start reducing the prison population by having a presumption against short sentences which dont work and moving drug addicts and the mentally ill into more appropriate accomodation.
