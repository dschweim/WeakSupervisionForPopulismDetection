Press Release from Party: LibDem

Not enough to say sorry, there must be a plan says Cable

Wed, 14 Apr 2010

The Liberal Democrats have clear plans to break up the banks so that the recklessness of some bankers can never again hold the taxpayer to ransom," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on Gordon Browns admission that it was a mistake not to have taken a tougher line with the banks when he was Chancellor, Vince Cable said:

Its not enough just to hold your hands up and say sorry without having a plan for making sure that the same thing doesnt happen again.

Gordon Browns admission that he was swayed by the pleas of the City shows the danger of Tory plans to base economic policy on the wishes of vested interests.  The only people that we should be thinking about are the British people and whats best for them.
