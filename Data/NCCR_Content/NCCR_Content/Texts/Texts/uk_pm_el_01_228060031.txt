Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Town & Country

Common sense means valuing the distinctiveness of both town and country

    Implement a Strategy for Recovery from Foot and Mouth for farms and rural businesses
    Establish Regeneration Companies to revitalise inner cities and housing estates
    Abolish housebuilding targets which threaten our green fields
    Cut business rates for rural shops, pubs, garages and village post offices
    Cut fuel tax to help motorists

Local communities are life's essential harbours. They provide us with a strong sense of local identity. But too many are under enormous pressure. Our countryside, ignored by the Government, has been devastated by the Foot and Mouth crisis. There are too many urban and rural communities that are not sharing in our country's prosperity and where deprivation passes from generation to generation. There are other neighbourhoods where many young people cannot afford to live, despite having grown up there.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will restore to communities a sense that they can shape their neighbourhoods, influence local architecture and improve the quality of their surroundings. And we will take effective action to help our rural communities and businesses recover from the effects of Foot and Mouth.

"Farming and the countryside are in crisis. Foot and Mouth disease is but the latest in a series of blows inflicted on our farmers."
