The dangers of a hung parliament
Tuesday, April 20 2010
Houses of Parliament

As fears grow that Britain could be left with a hung parliament, it's clear that only a Conservative victory can bring the change our country needs.

A vote for Labour and the Lib Dems could leave us stuck with Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, and the uncertainty of a hung Parliament could kill the economic recovery.

This is a landmark election that will decide the future of Britain. Our economy, society and politics are all broken. Fixing them requires a stable government with the energy and ideas to get Britain moving.

That's why a hung Parliament would be risky for Britain. As well as risking Gordon Brown carrying on as Prime Minister, we would also risk getting a weak government that is unable to take the tough decisions needed to cut our debt.

Independent economic experts forecast that this could mean higher interest rates, falling house prices and a run on the pound.

Only with a clear Conservative victory will we be able to cut Labour's waste and stop their jobs tax. We have a credible plan to reduce our deficit, but Gordon Brown offers more of the same.

A hung Parliament spells real uncertainty. Only the Conservatives offer real change.
