Labour will kill the recovery
Monday, April 5 2010
Brown recovery plan

The Conservatives have launched a poster highlighting how Labours job tax will kill the recovery.

"Labour have confirmed today that they are going ahead with a national insurance tax rise on jobs that Britains business leaders say will endanger jobs", said George Osborne, the Shadow Chancellor.

The poster is part of a wider campaign. The Conservatives have also unveiled new research showing how National Insurance has become Labour's favourite stealth tax:

    Total receipts from National Insurance have risen over five times faster than income tax receipts over the last decade.
    Average National Insurance Contributions (NICs) per family have risen over twelve times as much as average income tax receipts per family over the same period.
    In that time Gordon Brown cut the basic rate of income tax once (as part of the 10p tax con) but he increased National Insurance rates in three different ways  and thats even before Labours new tax on jobs planned for 2011

"With Gordon Brown now finally forced to call the election, the choice is clear", Osborne added.

"Labours jobs tax and debt will stamp out the green shoots and kill the recovery. Conservative plans to cut wasteful government spending and stop the jobs tax will get Britain working."
