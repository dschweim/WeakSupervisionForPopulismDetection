Press Release from Party: LibDem

Routine bleep tests wont solve obesity crisis says Lamb

Mon, 15 Mar 2010

Labour has failed when it comes to our childrens health," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on the Chief Medical Officers report released today which calls for fitness tests for children in secondary schools, Norman Lamb said:
 
Sir Liam Donaldson is right to raise concerns about the state of our childrens health but routine bleep tests wont by themselves solve the obesity crisis facing the country.
 
Labour has failed when it comes to our childrens health. Gordon Brown claimed three years ago that every child would get the chance to do five hours of sport each week but less than a third are doing it.
 
Its hardly surprising that physical activity has declined and obesity soared when ministers spend all their time obsessing about targets, process and surveys.

Physical activity should be a central part of our childrens lives, not an optional extra. This means protecting playing fields, ensuring lottery money is spent on facilities and improving links between schools and community clubs so kids have somewhere to keep playing sport once they leave school.
