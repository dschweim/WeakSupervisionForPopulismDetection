As the General Election approaches the final stretch, Conservatives released a report card revealing Labours failure across the English regions.

On the key issues of concern to voters, Labour have spent billions yet failed to improve the quality of life for many millions of people across the country.

"We're holding Labour to account", said Conservative Party Chairman Eric Pickles.

"Thirteen years of Labour and what we're left with is a budgetary black hole and more empty promises".

Conservatives released a "report card" of Labour's record of failure in the regions. You can download a pdf for each region from the right-hand sidebar.

The report card looks at Labour's record on jobs, the economy, crime, NHS, education and transport.

"If I were a teacher, Id look at Labours record in Yorkshire and give them an F", Pickles added.
