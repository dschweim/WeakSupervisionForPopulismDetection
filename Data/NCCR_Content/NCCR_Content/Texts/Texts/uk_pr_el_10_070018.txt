Press Release from Party: UKIP

MPs tell leaders to get tough on immigration

Wednesday, 31st March 2010

The Co-Chairmen of the Cross-Party Group on Balanced Migration today fell in behind UKIP and published an open letter to the leaders of the main three parties challenging them to toughen their policies on immigration.

On the day Gordon Brown gives a speech on Britains immigration problem, Frank Field MP and Nicholas Soames MP said: Immigration is one of the British publics major concerns yet none of the major parties has a sufficiently firm policy on immigration just days away from a General Election campaign. 

As it seems likely that the three main parties will stick their heads in the sand and avoid an explicit commitment to prevent Britains population from soaring to 70 million in 20 years, we have today set out the kind of measures any future government will have to introduce if we are to tackle this crucial issue before it is too late.

The MPs go on to say that Britain will be unable to cope with a population of 70m and will become intolerably overcrowded. They suggest measures including a clampdown on student visa applications, English tests for aspiring immigrants and no amnesty for illegal immigrants.

UKIP has called for an end to mass uncontrolled immigration since the party was founded. The Party manifesto outlines UKIPs proposals for a five-year moratorium on immigration, a new system of strict points-based visas and a tripling of UK Border Agency staff.
