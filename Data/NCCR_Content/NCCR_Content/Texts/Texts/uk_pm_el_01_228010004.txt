Keeping People Healthy

To support good health it is vital to tackle poverty and to have a clean environment. But it is also important that the National Health Service delivers high quality preventive care. The NHS should not just be a National Sickness Service. We will invest more in early detection and prevention, and in improving the environment. This will not only achieve better levels of health, but also save money in the long run. Liberal Democrats will:

    Inject an extra £500 million over five years into dental services. The money will be used to guarantee access for everyone to an NHS dentist. We will do so by rewarding dentists' for working in the NHS and offering them incentives to invest in new equipment and buildings, to encourage practitioners to return to NHS work. The British Dental Association estimates that this would bring back the equivalent of 1000 full-time dentists to NHS work.

    Double the Government’s commitment to invest more in the latest scanning and diagnostic equipment. We will provide extra advanced equipment in hospitals across the country.

    Restore free NHS dental check-ups for all to promote oral health and prevent disease.

    Provide free eye checks for all to ensure that problems are spotted earlier.

    Appoint a Minister of Public Health based in the Cabinet Office rather than the Department of Health to co-ordinate all aspects of public health policy across government departments.

    Make more tests available in GP surgeries and pharmacies for diabetes, cholesterol, anaemia, HIV/AIDS, TB, prostate and colorectal diseases.

    Promote a wider availability of complementary medicines and healthcare through the NHS to take maximum advantage of different approaches to health.
