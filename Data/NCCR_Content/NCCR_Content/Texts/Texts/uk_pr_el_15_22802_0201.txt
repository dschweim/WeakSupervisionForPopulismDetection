    Today we’ve learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week - Ed Miliband


    Ed Miliband, Leader of the Labour Party, speaking ahead of an event in Yorkshire, said:

    “Today we’ve learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week.

    “The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families.

    “The Tories’ secret plan has been revealed.

    “And they will put it into practice in just seven days’ time if they get the chance.

    “It’s the final proof that working families can’t afford five years of the Tories.?”
