Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Earning a living

Common sense means less tax and regulation for people and businesses

    Lower taxes for businesses, families, savers, pensioners and motorists
    Public spending not to outstrip the growth of the economy
    No more stealth taxes - transparent economic policy
    Cut the cost of regulation on business every year
    Keep the pound

It is getting harder for people and businesses in Britain to earn a living.

It should be getting easier. The tough decisions and hard choices made by the British people and Conservative
Governments in the 1980s and 1990s transformed our economic prospects, and made Britain's businesses competitive.

But instead of advancing further we are slipping back. People who have to watch every penny, see more and more of their money taken by the Government. Businesses are spending too much time dealing with new regulations, with too little time to focus on their customers.

It would be disastrous to re-elect a Government whose central economic policy is to increase tax and regulation by stealth.

It's time for common sense.

We will cut taxes on people and businesses and cut government interference and regulation in order to match the competition in the global marketplace.
