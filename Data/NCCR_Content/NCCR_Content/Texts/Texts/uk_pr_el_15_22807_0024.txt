"We are the only party in this campaign saying Britain should have a trade relationship with Europe, but not membership of the European Union.

"Directly as a consequence of that, we are the only party in this election that is actually offering a solution to the immigration crisis."

UKIP's pledge to Britain:

1. Say NO to the EU
2. Control our Borders
3. Extra £3 billion for the NHS
4. Cut foreign aid spending
5. No tax on the minimum wage
