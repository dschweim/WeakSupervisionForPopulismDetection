Mephedrone decision could have been made weeks ago says Huhne

Mon, 29 Mar 2010

This is a shambles that Alan Johnson could and should have avoided if he had respected the proper processes," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on Alan Johnsons announcement that mephedrone is to be made a Class B drug, Chris Huhne said:

The Home Secretary would have been able to take this decision weeks ago if he had not meddled in independent scientific advice because he did not like what it said.
 
His intervention sparked a number of resignations from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and left the Government scrabbling around for independent advice.
 
This is a shambles that Alan Johnson could and should have avoided if he had respected the proper processes.
