Press Release from Party: Greens

No job should be paying poverty wages"

11 April 2010

 

 

In a new campaign video launched today, Darren Johnson, Green candidate for Lewisham Deptford, covers his hopes for employment, poverty, and the NHS.

He says: "As all the other parties are going into this election talking about cuts, we're the only ones that are talking about a serious programme of investment to tackle unemployment and create jobs.

"We have a costed programme to create a million new jobs nationally, providing free care for the elderly, building more affordable housing to tackle the housing crisis, and bringing all our homes up to energy efficient standards through a national home insulation program."

Darren goes on to address payment issues: "Four million children in this country live in poverty and, under Labour, the gap between rich and poor has been growing ... and that's why Greens have been pushing, very strongly, for a living wage.

"Here in this park, for example, park workers across the borough get paid a living wage now, thanks to the Greens, giving them enough to provide for themselves and their families. We need that for every job. No job should be paying poverty wages."

Darren, who has been a London Assembly member for a decade and is currently chair of the London Assembly, concludes: "The NHS is one of Britain's proudest achievements but this government is obsessed with treating the NHS like a business not a service.

"The needs of the patients often seem to be forgotten. What we need is an NHS that's run as a public service in the way that it was set up to be."
