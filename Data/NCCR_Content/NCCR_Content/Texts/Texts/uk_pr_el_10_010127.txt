Press Release from Party: LibDem

 Get tough on businesses exploiting illegal immigrants says Chris Huhne

Wed, 14 Apr 2010

If public confidence is to be restored, we need to get tough on businesses employing illegal immigrants, the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary said.

Commenting on the Channel 4 News report that a UK Border Agency audit of health service contracts has found 8% of cleaning workers were illegal, Chris Huhne said:

This just proves that there is nowhere near enough enforcement on employers who are exploiting illegal immigrants.

Only 114 employers have been prosecuted and convicted since 1997, which is a bad joke.

If public confidence is to be restored, we need to get tough on businesses employing illegal immigrants.
