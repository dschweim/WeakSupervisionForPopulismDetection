23 April, 2015 @ 12:01 AM

Liberal Democrats believe that no matter who you are, where you come from and what your circumstances, no one should be denied the opportunity to fulfill their potential. 

In order to build a fairer society, we must break down the unfair divisions in our society and in government again, Liberal Democrats will ensure that disabled people get the support and help they need.

Our Disability Manifesto sets out how we will work to improve the benefits system for disabled people and move towards joined up health care services.
