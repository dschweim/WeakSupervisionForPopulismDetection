Party Manifesto: UKIP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

5 Defence
Over the years, successive governments havestarved the British armed forces of money. This has meant insufficient equipment, overstretched resources and excessive tours of duty, which can badly damage the fabric offamily life. UKIP has huge regard for our Armed Forces and the work they do. We are prepared to provide proper defence resources and bring an end to devastating cuts. UKIP will:· Spend an extra 40% on defence annually, another 1% of GDP· Expand the Army by 25% to 125,000 personnel and double the size of the Territorial Army· Restore the Royal Navy to its 2001 strength with three new aircraft carriers and nearly 70 other ships, at the same time guaranteeing the future of the Plymouth, Portsmouth and Rosyth bases· Increase RAF capability by buying moreessential helicopters, transport aircraft and 50 extra JSF Lightning aircraft· Restore historic regiments, such as theHighland regiments, which are being subsumed into planned European battle groups· Strengthen our commitment to NATO, while withdrawing from all EU operations· Reappraise our operations in Afghanistanto create a single, clear and achievablemission or seek to negotiate a withdrawal with our NATO partners· Maintain Britain’s independent nucleardeterrent with existing Trident submarines and then replace them with four British-builtsubmarines armed with US missiles· Cut MOD bureaucracy, which has one civil servant for every two military personnel· Introduce better pay, conditions and medical care for the British Armed Forces personnel and their familiesDownload the full Defence policy from the Policies section of www.ukip.org
