Labour launches housing manifesto

gordon brownPrime Minister Gordon Brown and John Healey, Labour's Housing Minister, today launched Labour's housing manifesto, setting out how Labour will help provide everyone with a secure, decent and affordable home in a safe community.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown said:

"Today we are publishing our housing manifesto  setting out how, literally, we will lay the foundations for the future.

"We have kept the construction industry going through the recession  bringing forward investment to protect jobs.

"And we have protected homeowners, making repossession a last resort. Repossessions are today running at half the rate of the early 1990s recession.  Crucially, and in contrast to the Tory Government in the early 1990s, we swiftly extended support for mortgage interest payments, and have extended it for the rest of this year. We have scrapped stamp duty for two years for first time buyers buying houses under 250,000 and we will keep supporting the house builders by bringing forward investment in affordable homes."

John Healey said:

"Labour's plan for housing shows our continued commitment to using the power of public investment to help meet the needs and aspirations of people across our country."

"Labour's extra investment which has kept Britain building through recession was opposed by the Tories. Our help for housebuilding, supporting 160,000 jobs and creating 3,000 new apprenticeships, is at risk from the Tories. They would cut spending on housebuilding and paralyse the planning system, removing the duty on councils to plan for new affordable housing. Our action in recession and the Tories opposition show why Labour is the only Party to secure the recovery."
