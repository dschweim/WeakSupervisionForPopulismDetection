I've finally finished my first book. It's been 10 years in the making.

Consumed By Love
How oneness with Christ changes absolutely everything

Our publishers are getting it ready for print in December in time to launch it on our 20 year Toronto Revival anniversary celebrations on January 20th 2014. I'm over the top excited for that day! Thank you Jesus for perfect timing! :)
