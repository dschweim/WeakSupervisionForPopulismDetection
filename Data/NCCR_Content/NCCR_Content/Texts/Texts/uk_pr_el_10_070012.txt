Press Release from Party: UKIP

Beer duty hike spells end of British pub

Wednesday, 24th March 2010

The 5% increase in beer duty has signalled the death knell of the traditional British pub.

Nick Hogan, the UKIP spokesman on the pub trade, responded to Chancellor Alistair Darlings Budget announcement of a 2% above inflation (which stands at 3%) increase in beer duty as a crime against culture.

Duty has risen 20 per cent over the past  two years already.

"It is apparent that this government has no understanding of this country and no love for its traditions, said Mr Hogan.

The pub trade is beleaguered enough already and to hit it with price increases of 10p per pint is a travesty.

He obviously wants people to get their drinks from cheap supermarkets and hang around in parks, because that will be the result.? 

Over 40 pubs a week are closing already, and he wants to accelerate the problem.? 

At last it might be true, it will no longer be the smoking ban that has driven the pub trade to the brink of oblivion, it is the deliberate economic policy of this failed government.
