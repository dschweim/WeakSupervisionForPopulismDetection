Press Release from Party: SNP

Tom Farmer backs fiscal autonomy
Thu, 29/04/2010 - 12:11

SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie welcomed Sir Tom Farmer's backing for full fiscal autonomy. Writing in the Herald, Sir Tom said the case for financial independence for Scotland was now "overwhelming", and called on other business and civic leaders to get behind the proposal.

Mr Hosie said:

"Sir Tom's call for Holyrood to be responsible for raising all the money it spends is very welcome. As one of Scotland's most successful and respected businessmen, his endorsement carries enormous weight and will hopefully encourage others to support this commonsense solution to the country's funding needs.

"The case for full fiscal autonomy has never been more urgent. At a time when all the London parties are sizing up Scotland's budget for savage cuts, we need the ability to grow our own economy to spread wealth and help protect vital public services.

"The time has come for Scotland to take full responsibility for its own finances."
