Press Release from Party: LibDem

Met police advertising ban proves Labour claims cannot be trusted said Huhne

Fri, 26 Mar 2010

Only the Liberal Democrats are budgeting for more police to keep crime coming down," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on the Metropolitan Police advertising ban by the Advertising Standards Authority due to untrue claims about the amount of time officers spend on the beat, Chris Huhne said:

It took the Advertising Standards Authority to say that this Labour government is not legal, decent, honest or truthful.

Voters should not be fooled by Labour claims about the time police officers spend on the beat, as neither Labour nor the Tories are prepared to commit to increasing police numbers.

Only the Liberal Democrats are budgeting for more police to keep crime coming down.
