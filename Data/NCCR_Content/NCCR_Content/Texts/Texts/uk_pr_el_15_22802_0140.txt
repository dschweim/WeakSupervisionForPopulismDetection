    Harriet Harman response to the Conservative Party manifesto

    Harriet Harman, Labour’s Deputy Leader, responding to the Conservative Party manifesto, said:

    “The Conservative Party have not and will not stand up for working families. It is working people who have paid the price of the last five years, with higher taxes and wages down £1,600.

    "And it is working people that will pay the price of the Tories’ desperate campaign. 

    "There is nothing more dangerous to the NHS than saying you will protect it, without being able to say where the money will come from.

    "And their flaky election bribes from housing to childcare will leave working people paying the price in higher taxes. Their manifesto confirms that the Tories have £25bn of promises which they have no way of paying for, while refusing to rule out extending VAT to areas such as food and children clothes. That means higher taxes for every working person in this country.

    "Yesterday Labour showed that it was the party of change and the party of responsibility with a fully funded manifesto that does not require any extra borrowing. The Conservative manifesto today shows once again that working people can’t afford five more years of the Tories.”
