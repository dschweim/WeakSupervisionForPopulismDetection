Look left, look right, then cross with the Liberal Democrats

A new poster unveiled by the Liberal Democrats shows that a Labour or Conservative government would lurch economic policy dangerously to the left or the right.

The poster highlights the crossroads facing the British public at the General Election and points to the dangers of leaving Ed Balls or George Osborne in charge of the nation's finances.

It was unveiled by Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander who has set out the party's vision for the economic future of the country.

The Liberal Democrat economic plan shows:

    We will borrow £70bn less than Labour and cut £50bn less than the Tories.
    Labour’s mañana-mañana approach to deficit reduction would drag out austerity for the whole of the next parliament.
    The Conservatives would slash Government spending on public services and roads, railways and housing to the lowest it has been in over half a century.
    We will balance Britain’s books fairly and then be able to turn the corner.  With us, there is light at the end of the tunnel. 

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said:

“Only the Liberal Democrats can build the strong, modern open economy Britain needs to become Europe’s biggest economy.

“We’ll keep Britain’s recovery on course and we’ll invest in the future – giving people the opportunities they need to thrive.

“This is our plan for Britain’s future – a stronger economy and fairer society.”
