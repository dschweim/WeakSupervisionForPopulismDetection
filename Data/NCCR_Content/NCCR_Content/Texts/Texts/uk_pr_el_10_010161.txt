Press Release from Party: LibDem

IFS shows Tories and Labour not coming clean about cuts says Cable

Tue, 27 Apr 2010

The IFS clearly shows that the Liberal Democrats have gone further than any party in identifying the savings that will be needed to tackle the structural deficit," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report on the parties manifestos Vince Cable said:
 
On tackling the deficit:
 
The IFS clearly shows that the Liberal Democrats have gone further than any party in identifying the savings that will be needed to tackle the structural deficit.
 
The Conservatives have pledged to make the biggest cuts to spending since the Second World War without coming clean about where the axe will fall. 
 
The IFS also shows both Labour and the Conservatives are hiding behind vague efficiency savings to avoid coming clean about their proposals.
 
On tax proposals:
 
We welcome the IFSs overall assessment that the Liberal Democrat plans to raise the personal allowance to 10,000 is progressive, adds up and gives people an incentive to work.
 
This is in stark contrast to the assessment of Conservative tax plans, which the IFS have shown to be both regressive by rewarding the richest, as well as self contradictory.
 
As the IFS has shown, the Conservatives would have to reverse half of their proposed 6bn National Insurance tax cut to meet their own targets on tax.
