******NEW HOSPITAL PLANS AND CONSULTATION******

This is important information that I would like to pass on:

The Specialist and Critical Care Centre (SCCC) is a new hospital planned to be built in the Gwent area. It will concentrate specialist services currently provided in Nevill Hall Hospital, in Abergavenny and the Royal Gwent Hospital, in Newport on a single site.
No decisions have been made about the future location of these services and they will not be made until the consultation process is complete.

The South Wales Programme presentation being used at all the public meetings is now available on the website, together with a high contrast version for people with a visual impairment. 
Word versions of the English and Welsh-language consultation documents are also available at www.wales.nhs.uk/swp. These are compatible with e-readers.
