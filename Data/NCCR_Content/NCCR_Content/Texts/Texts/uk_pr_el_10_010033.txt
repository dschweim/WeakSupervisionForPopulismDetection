Brown needs to apologise, not clarify says Harvey

Wed, 17 Mar 2010

He should apologise for the fact that under his watch our troops have not had the equipment they need to do the job," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Defence Secretary.

Commenting on Gordon Browns announcement that he is writing to the Iraq Inquiry to clarify evidence he gave on defence cuts, Nick Harvey said:

Gordon Brown should do more than simply clarify the matter with the Iraq Inquiry.
 
He should apologise for the fact that under his watch our troops have not had the equipment they need to do the job.
 
They have struggled without sufficient helicopters for too long.
 
It is a scandal that it has taken so long to get the Snatch Land Rover out of service in Afghanistan.
