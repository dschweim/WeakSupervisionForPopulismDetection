"It's fantastic news and very exciting for us," said Mr O'Flynn, who is also UKIP's Economics spokesman.

"Nick Clarke is a huge political talent and his joining the Party will be a massive shot in the arm to my campaign in Cambridge and to UKIP candidates throughout the country.

"It really underlines the case that UKIP is getting traction in Cambridge. I think it will bring many disenchanted voters former Tory voters along, to at least consider voting UKIP."

Writing on his own site, Mr Clarke said that: "My reasons for joining UKIP are many. The UK’s relationship with the EU is a significant but not exclusive reason for joining UKIP.

He continued: "I now have no confidence that the Conservative party is able to deliver on an exit from the EU. Nor am I convinced that it even wants to.

He also praised UKIP's Patrick O'Flynn for being "clearly head and shoulders above the Conservative candidate dropped in from London".
