Press Release from Party: LibDem

Nick Clegg launches Liberal Democrat manifesto

Wed, 14 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg today launched his partys General Election manifesto, setting out four clear priorities of fair taxes, a fair chance for every child, a fair economy, and a fair deal by cleaning up politics.



Nick Clegg said:

Every manifesto needs to have an idea at its heart. The basic idea that animates this manifesto is something I have always believed. I believe every single person is extraordinary.

The tragedy is that we have a society where too many people never get to fulfil that extraordinary potential.

My view  the liberal view  is that governments job is to help them to do it. Not to tell people how to live their lives. But to make their choices possible, to release their potential, no matter who they are.

The way to do that is to take power away from those who hoard it. To challenge vested interests. To break down privilege. To clear out the bottlenecks in our society that block opportunity and block progress. And so give everyone a chance to live the life they want.

Theres a simple word for those ideas, and its a word this manifesto is built on: fairness.
