News story
Gordon Brown should clarify comments on immigration statistics
Tuesday, March 30 2010
Chris Grayling

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling has written to the head of the UK Statistics Authority to ask for an investigation into Gordon Browns misleading use of immigration statistics.

"This is another extraordinary example of Gordon Browns dishonesty", Grayling said.

He has asked the UK Statistics Authority to request that the Prime Minister clarifies his remarks and undertakes not to mislead the public during the forthcoming General Election campaign.

Gordon Browns claims on immigration were exposed at the end of last week as misleading and likely to damage public trust in official statistics.

In attempting to argue that immigration levels have fallen during his time in Downing Street, Gordon Brown was reduced to comparing two different sets of statistics in a way which misled the public.

"After this no one will believe their claims on crime and immigration anymore", Grayling added. "There can be no clearer example of why Britain desperately needs change".
