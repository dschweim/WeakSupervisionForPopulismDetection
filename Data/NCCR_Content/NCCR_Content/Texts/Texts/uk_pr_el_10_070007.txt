UKIP pub expert calls for budget lifeline

Tuesday, 23rd March 2010

The first landlord to be jailed under smoking ban laws today called on the Alistair Darling to offer a lifeline to the ailing pub industry in Wednesday's budget speech.

UKIP pub spokesman Nick Hogan said: "The Chancellor must resist any thought to increase beer duty in the new budget. He must also revisit the smoking ban that is exacerbating all the financial crimes committed against the pub trade". 

Hogan's remarks come after Alastair Darby, head of the Marston's tenanted division said that up to 10,000 pubs are likely to close in the next five years.

Hogan added: "Pubcos and the Government have to stop using pubs as a cash cow, and recognise these are family businesses and the families suffer as well.

"A Frenchman once said that when England loses its inns, England will be no more. Frighteningly, that prediction seems more and more relevant in 2010."
