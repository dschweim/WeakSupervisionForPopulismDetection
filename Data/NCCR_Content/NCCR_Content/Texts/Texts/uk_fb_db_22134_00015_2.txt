As part of my role as Business Minister, today Im naming and shaming companies who failed to pay their workers the national minimum wage. In my view there's no excuse for companies that don't pay staff the wages they're entitled to - whether theyre wilfully breaking the law, or simply making irresponsible mistakes.
I am proud that Lib Dems in Government are protecting workers by cracking down on employers who ignore minimum wage rules. As well as naming and shaming, we've increased the penalty fines and boosted the resources available to investigate non-compliance. You can read more about this here
