Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1974
-------------------------------------

People in Scotland and Wales

A recurring theme in our programme is the need to recognise that people want more freedom and more control over their own lives. This is what has shaped our policies for Scotland and Wales.

In Scotland we will:

    set up a Scottish Assembly;
    give the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting with the Scottish Assembly, the power to decide how to spend Scotland's share of the UK budget;
    establish a Scottish Development Fund, as stated earlier, to provide substantial help with both the new problems created by oil, and with Scotland's old deprived areas;
    transfer the Oil Division of the Department of Energy to Scotland. 

In Wales, we will:

    increase the powers and the functions of the Secretary of State for Wales and ensure that Wales' share of the UK budget is spent in accordance with decisions taken in Wales and the Welsh Office;
    establish a new Select Committee of Welsh MPs entitled to meet in Cardiff as well as at Westminster;
    strengthen the functions of the Welsh Council and reconstitute its membership so that the majority will be elected from the new County and District Councils. 

In Scotland and Wales we are publishing separate manifestos, setting out these plans and others in more detail.
