The Environmental Balance Sheet

Positives

    Britain has a massive advantage in natural resources that gives it the potential to be at the forefront of renewable energy generation. Government estimates show that up to 45% of electricity demand could be met from wind power.
    Government action can significantly affect standards of environmental protection. The market share of unleaded petrol rose from 1.1% to 43.0% between August 1998 and November 1991, due to widening tax differentials.
    Britain has a positive record on protecting its countryside. More of our land is protected in National Parks than any other EC member, and one more has recently been announced, in the New Forest.

Negatives

    In too many ways Britain unfortunately deserves its nickname of The Dirty Man of Europe. Carbon dioxide emissions - the main source of global warming - increased in the UK from 525 million tonnes in 1986 to 530 million in 1989.
    The UK produces more sulphur dioxide, the main cause of acid rain, than any other EC member, but is only now beginning to install pollution-control devices to power stations. Germany started in 1984.
    Prosecutions for water pollution more than doubled between 1981 and 1988, while an additional 40 beaches were found not to be complying with EC standards in 1990 - making a total of 20% of all British beaches.
    The Government has failed to invest in the development of renewable energy sources - despite the fact that they avoid the pollution problems associated with coal, oil and gas. Currently, just over GBP 20 million is spent annually on renewable energy research and development, compared to more than GBP 200 million a year on nuclear power.
    Even worse, the Government has cut the budget of the Energy Efficiency Office, while investment in energy conservation would save money and reduce pollution. The 1990-91 level of funding, a meagre GBP 23 million, is lower than it was four years before.
    Pollution from road transport has risen from 884 million tonnes of nitrogen oxides in 1980 to 1,298 million tonnes in 1989.
    At the same time, the proportion of freight carried on the railways between 1980 and 1990 dropped from 9% to 7%, while the proportion using road transport rose to 83%.
    Rail transport is placed at a disadvantage in Britain. Levele of government support for the railways fell throughout the 1980s, from GBP 1262 million in 1980-1981 to GBP 462 million in 1990-91.
