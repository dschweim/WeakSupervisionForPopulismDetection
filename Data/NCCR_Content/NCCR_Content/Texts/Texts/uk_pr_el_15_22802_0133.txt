    Labour response to Tory inheritance tax announcement
    Chris Leslie, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responding to the Conservative Party’s announcement on inheritance tax, said:

    “This is just the latest panicky promise from the Tories, but we’ve heard it all before. The Tories made a promise on inheritance tax before the last election and they broke it. 
    “At a time when our NHS is in crisis and most working people are paying more under the Tories, it cannot be a priority to spend £1 billion on a policy which the Treasury says would not apply to 90 per cent of estates. The Tories would choose to give a £140,000 tax cut for a house worth £2m while they have increased VAT on families and pensioners.

    “Labour has made a different, fairer choice. We will go further on restricting pension tax relief for the very highest earners in order to cut tuition fees and increase grants for the next generation. 
    “The big question for the Tories this weekend is how they will pay for the billions of pounds of promises they are racking up. Alongside their extreme plan to double the pace of spending cuts next year, their unfunded promises mean the Tories will end up putting our NHS at risk and raising VAT again.”
