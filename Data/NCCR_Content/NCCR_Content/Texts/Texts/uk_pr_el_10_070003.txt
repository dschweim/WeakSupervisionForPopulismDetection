Press Release from Party: UKIP

ASA: climate change ad was propaganda

Tuesday, 16th March 2010

Climate change sceptics are celebrating a victory after the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint about the accuracy of Government climate change adverts.

Claims the Government made in two press adverts were deemed to be exaggerated, distressing and misleading.

One advert depicted a drawing of three men floating in a bath-tub amid scenes of flooding which included a half submerged car and houses and a church part under water. The other advert included a drawing of a young girl and boy looking for water at a well on a hill. The caption Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water' ended with the line, There was none, as extreme weather due to climate change had caused a drought.'

UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom was one of the hundereds of people who complained. He said: "UKIP are the only party that believe man-made climate change does not exist, and our view has been vindicated by today's ruling.

"What is truly nauseating is that the Government wasted 56 million on this propagandist rubbish

"People are fed up with spin and lies from this Governement, they are desperate for some straight talking on this issue.

He went on, "They say that nearly a thousand people complained when these adverts were screened, but it was far more than that. When I went to their website to make my own complaint I was met with a message telling me not to bother, they had already received so many.

The full report will be published on the ASA website, www.asa.org.uk, on Wednesday.

Further complaints, that the adverts were politically-motivated, have been referred to Ofcom, by the ASA.
