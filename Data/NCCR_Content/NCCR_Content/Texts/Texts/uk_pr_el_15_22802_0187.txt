    Comment on the Tories’ small business letter

    Chuka Umunna, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, commenting on the Tories’ small business letter said:

    “The Tories have spent five years letting down Britain’s small businesses. Government scheme after government scheme designed to boost finance for small firms has failed, and small business lending has fallen by £500m in the last three months.

    "With Labour, the tax burden on small firms will be lower than under the Tories who have overseen an increase in business rates of around £1,500.

    "Labour’s Better Plan will cut - then freeze - business rates, set up a Small Business Administration and a proper British Investment Bank to back small businesses. And only Labour will tackle late payment and the unfair treatment of small suppliers we’ve seen under the Tories.”
