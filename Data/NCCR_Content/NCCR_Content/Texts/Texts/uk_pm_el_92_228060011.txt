Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1992

BRITAIN'S OPPORTUNITY

We are now members of:

    The biggest free market in the world. British industry is again respected in Europe.
    A zone of low inflation, in which we can compete with the best. 

Britain must not throw this opportunity away by electing a Labour government. The world recession has been tough for all of us, at home and abroad. Unemployment has risen. But in Britain we have laid the foundations for recovery What is needed to trigger confidence and growth is a Conservative victory with a decisive majority. What would postpone recovery, and turn this promise of growth into the certainty of hard times, is the election of our opponents whose policies would mean higher taxes, higher inflation, higher interest rates, more bureaucratic regulation and more strikes.

In the 1990s, the Government's task will be to provide an economic environment which encourages enterprise - the mainspring of prosperity. Our aims must be:

    To achieve price stability.
    To keep firm control over public spending.
    To continue to reduce taxes as fast as we prudently can.
    To make sure that market mechanisms and incentives are allowed to do their job. 

Price stability does not mean a frozen economy in which no price ever moves. But we must drive inflation down so low that it no longer affects the decisions made by ordinary people, businesses and government.

When inflation rises, so do bankruptcies. When inflation falls, industry can plan again for a profitable future. Inflation creates strife, as different groups in society struggle to restore their living standards. It destroys jobs. It erodes savings and social benefits and threatens our currency.
