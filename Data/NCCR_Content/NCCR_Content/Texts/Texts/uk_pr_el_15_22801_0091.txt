The manifesto plans announced by Nick Clegg include:

    Bringing forward at least 10 new garden cities in England providing tens of thousands of high quality new homes.
    Direct government commissioning of private house building to ensure houses are built at sufficient speed and have proper infrastructure and services.
    A new Housing Investment Bank to provide long term capital for major new developments.
    New Rent to Own homes where your monthly payments steadily buy you a stake in your house.
    New Help to Rent scheme to help millions of young people put down a deposit to rent their first property.

Commenting Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg said:

"Liberal Democrats believe everyone should have the opportunity to have a decent home at a cost they can afford.  

 "That's why we have increased house building in government but we want to go much further.

 "And we will help young people who want a home of their own with radical plans to help them buy or rent."
