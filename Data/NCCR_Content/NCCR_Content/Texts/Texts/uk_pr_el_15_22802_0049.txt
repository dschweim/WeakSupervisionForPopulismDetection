    Response from Ed Miliband to broadcasters’ announcement on TV debates

    Responding to the broadcasters’ announcement on TV debates, Ed Miliband, Leader of the Labour Party said:

    “David Cameron is now in the ridiculous position where he’ll go to the same studio as me, on the same night as me, with the same audience as me but he won’t debate me head to head as he’s running scared.

    “I’m going to keep the offer of a head to head debate on the table right up to Election Day as it’s what the British people want and what they deserve.”
