Press Release from Party: LibDem

Equitable Life victims should get proper compensation says Vince Cable

Sat, 03 Apr 2010

"The Government has repeatedly dragged its feet and the Tories have been equivocal in their support," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on Tory plans to pay out compensation to Equitable Life victims, Vince Cable said:

I have been leading on this issue and raising it repeatedly in Parliament for the last 10 years. I put forward a motion which was supported by more people, of all parties, than any other motion in the last session.

It committed all parties to supporting a proper level of compensation for Equitable Life victims. The issue is no longer about the principle; the issue is about the speed and process.

The Government has repeatedly dragged its feet and the Tories have been equivocal in their support.
