Labours Budget makes tax system even more unfair says Carmichael

Wed, 24 Mar 2010

This Budget was an exercise in concealing the true scale of changes and cuts that are going to be necessary to get out of the economic hole in which Labour will leave us," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Scotland Secretary.

Commenting on todays Budget, Alistair Carmichael said:

If this Budget was the launch of the General Election campaign, then Labour candidates must be despairing.

Instead of making taxation fairer for the poorest in our community, Alistair Darling chose to freeze the level of personal income tax allowance, making an already unfair system even more unfair.

The increase in fuel duty is a further blow to Scotlands rural areas. As Nick Clegg said, but as Labour fails to understand. the fundamental problem with fuel duty is that for rural areas a car is a necessity, not a luxury.

The Government has so far failed to get RBS and Lloyds HBOS lending to sound Scottish businesses  why should we believe them when they say theyre going to start now?

This Budget was an exercise in concealing the true scale of changes and cuts that are going to be necessary to get out of the economic hole in which Labour will leave us.

Liberal Democrat MEP for Scotland, George Lyon said:
 
The Labour Government has failed to listen to thousands of families across Scotland who are crying out for fairer fuel duty.
 
A phased three pence increase in fuel duty is still an increase. The Government has missed an opportunity to target fuel duty reductions at rural communities where driving is a necessity, not a luxury.
