Party Manifesto: Green (uk) - National Elections 2010

waste
Reduce, reuse –and only then recycleGovernment must provide the infrastructureto make it easy to do the right thing.We would:• Do the simple things like providing a freecompost bin and composting advice foranyone who wants them.• Allow councils to integrate locally thedomestic and commercial waste systems.• Oppose the incineration of waste,but encourage domestic composting.• Almost double spending on recycling andwaste disposal.We have to recognise thatsophisticated waste management costs morethan burying it in the ground.We wouldspend an extra £3bn pa, creating 60,000 jobs.Burying waste gives rise to both greenhousegases and pollution, and is no longeracceptable.• Design products and packaging with aview to what happens to them when theycease to be useful.We will use taxation onunnecessary packaging to discourage its use,and would be prepared to regulate the waythings are made so as to prevent thementering the waste system.• Aim to recycle 70% of domestic waste by2015 as a move towards a zero-waste system.The Government provides the infrastructure,people do the recycling.
