Natalie Bennett welcomes a new Green Party member

17 March 2015

Natalie Bennett has welcomed chef and anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe to The Green Party.

Ms Monroe said she had been "chewing over" joining the Green Party since meeting Natalie more than a year ago. [1]

Natalie Bennett, leader of The Green Party, said:

“I’m very pleased to welcome Jack to the Green Party. She’s one of over 40,000 people who have joined the fastest growing political movement in England & Wales in the last year.

I share Jack’s deep concern with the tone of the debate on immigration. I’m proud to live in a welcoming, tolerant and diverse Britain – and I’m proud to represent a party that stands up to the vicious rhetoric on immigration we’re seeing in this country.
 
I’m looking forward to working with Jack in putting forward a positive case for an economy that works for everyone in Britain. That means making the Minimum Wage a Living Wage, tackling tax avoidance and creating a social security system that gives people the support they need."
