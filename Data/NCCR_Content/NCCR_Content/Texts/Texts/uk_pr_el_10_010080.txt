Thu, 01 Apr 2010

The drive to squeeze every last bit of value from taxpayers money shouldnt stop at town halls," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Communities Secretary.

Commenting on todays Taxpayers Alliance report showing that 31 council staff earned more than the Prime Minister last year, Julia Goldsworthy said:
 
People are right to be angry that so many public servants are earning more than the Prime Minister while many people are losing their job and home.
 
Public servants should have their pay increases capped at 400 so that those with the lowest incomes get the biggest increase in take home pay.
 
The drive to squeeze every last bit of value from taxpayers money shouldnt stop at town halls; we need to take a cleaver to the number of politicians, government departments and unelected quangos.
