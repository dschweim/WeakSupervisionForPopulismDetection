a fair deal for families of every shape and size
In Britain today, families come in all shapes and sizes. Liberal Democratsbelieve every family should get the support it needs to thrive, from helpwith childcare through to better support for carers and elderly parents.Liberal Democrats will improve life for your family. On top of our tax cuts toput £700 in the pockets of millions of low and middle-income earners, wewill allow mums and dads to share parental leave between them so theycan arrange family life in the way that suits them best. We will provide bettersupport for children at risk and young adults to help them thrive. We willrestore the earnings link for pensions, and offer respite breaks for carers.And we will protect families from unfair bills.help for families – right from the startThe first weeks, months and years after a child is born are enormouslyimportant, but the support arrangements are simply too inflexible at themoment. When a baby is born, the mother gets a year’s leave and the fathergets just two weeks, meaning the mother has to take the lion’s share of theresponsibility, even if their partner would rather share things more equally.Liberal Democrats will:• Give fathers the right to time off for ante-natal appointments.• Allow parents to share the allocation of maternity and paternity leavebetween them in whatever way suits them best.• Protect existing childcare support arrangements until the nation’sfinances can support a longer term solution: a move to 20 hoursfree childcare for every child, from the age of 18 months.
• Seek to extend the period of shared parental leave up to 18 monthswhen resources and economic circumstances allow.• Support efforts by childcare providers to encourage more men towork in this hugely important and undervalued profession.• Extend the right to request flexible working to all employees, makingit easier for grandparents, for example, to take a caring role.helping families stay strongEvery child deserves a happy life free from poverty and free from fear.Children face too many difficulties in today’s Britain; the Government is goingto fall far short of its target to cut child poverty, and young people have beendemonised by a generation of politicians more interested in sounding toughthan in offering help. Children are also the main victims of family breakdown.Liberal Democrats will:• Maintain the commitment to end child poverty in the UK by 2020.• Incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into UK law,ending the detention of children for immigration purposes.• Enhance child protection. We will enforce the publication of ananonymised version of Serious Case Reviews to ensure that lessonsare learned.• Support the objective of at least a 70 per cent reduction in childmaltreatment by 2030, promoted by the WAVE trust.• Help protect children and young people from developing negativebody images by regulating airbrushing in adverts.• Tackle online bullying by backing quick-report buttons on socialnetworking sites, enabling offensive postings to be speedily removed.• Strengthen the Youth Service by making it a statutory service, and byencouraging local authorities to provide youth services in partnershipwith young people and the voluntary sector.• Set the minimum wage at the same level for all workers over 16(except for those on apprenticeships).
• Introduce a Default Contact Arrangement which would dividethe child’s time between their two parents in the event of familybreakdown, if there is no threat to the safety of the child.dignity and security in later lifeThe way older people are treated is the mark of a fair society. Older peoplehave worked hard and contributed to society for decades; they deserve afair deal. Liberal Democrats will increase the inadequate basic state pensionand ensure fair treatment for everyone from government, public services andbusiness alike.That is why Liberal Democrats will:• Immediately restore the link between the basic state pension andearnings. We will uprate the state pension annually by whichever isthe higher of growth in earnings, growth in prices or 2.5 per cent.• Increase the income tax threshold to £10,000, saving mostpensioners around £100 a year.• Offer a week’s respite for the one million carers who spend 50 hoursevery week looking after a sick relative.• Scrap compulsory retirement ages, allowing those who wish tocontinue in work to do so.• Give you control over your own pension by scrapping the rules thatcompel you to buy an annuity when you reach 75.• In the long term, aim to bring in a Citizen’s Pension that will be paidto all UK citizens who are long-term residents, set at the level of thePension Credit, though this can only be done when resources allow.• Begin a national programme to insulate many more homes paid for bythe savings from lower energy bills.There is a further, serious, long-term crisis facing older people: thesustainability of the systems for providing long-term care. It is unacceptablethat this challenge has been treated as a political football. A Liberal DemocratGovernment would immediately establish an independent commission todevelop future proposals for long-term care that will attract all-party supportand so be sustainable. We believe that the eventual solution must be basedon the principles of fairness, affordability and sustainability.a fair deal for consumersWhile open markets usually deliver opportunity and prosperity, sometimesmarkets fail and consumers are badly treated by big business. The bankshave exploited their position of power to impose unfair charges. Energy billsare far too expensive for many people, and suppliers have not done enoughto protect those who cannot afford to keep warm.We will:• Change the tariffs used by energy supply companies so that the first,essential, energy you use is the cheapest. We’ll ensure that effectiveenergy efficiency measures are introduced to keep bills low and that‘social tariffs’ are available to guarantee the best price for all those inmost need. We will seek to extend protection and support to ‘off-gasgrid’consumers.• Address unfairness in water charges by consulting on theimplementation of the Walker Review which recommended action todeal with regional unfairness in water charges.
• Legislate to end unfair bank and financial transaction charges, soyou cannot be charged more than the costs incurred.• Improve access to banking for all with a PostBank, revenues fromwhich will also help to secure the future of the Post Office.• Impose maximum interest rates for credit cards and store cards,following consultation with the financial industry and consumer groups.• Introduce a Universal Service Code to secure high-quality customerservice in the private and public sectors, for example by requiring thatthe customer service phone number is free from mobiles and landlines.• Require a local competition test for all planning applications for newretail developments and establish a local competition office within theOffice of Fair Trading to investigate anti-competitive practices at alocal and regional level.• Require airlines to be honest and upfront about pricing, ending thepractice of adding hidden charges.• Cut rail fares, changing the rules in contracts with Train OperatingCompanies so that regulated fares fall behind inflation by 1 per centeach year, meaning a real-terms cut.• Make Network Rail refund a third of your ticket price if you have totake a rail replacement bus service.• Regulate the parking system to remove unfairness and stop privatesector wheel-clamping.enhanced protection for animalsLiberal Democrats believe that ownership and use of animals is aresponsibility that should not be abused.We will:• Merge existing quangos to establish an Animal Protection Commissionto investigate abuses, educate the public and enforce the law; it willalso be able to publish reports on its own initiative.• End testing of household products on animals.• Work for the proper enforcement of regulations for the transportationof live animals across all EU member states.
