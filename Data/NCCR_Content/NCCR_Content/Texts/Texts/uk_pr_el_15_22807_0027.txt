Jill Seymour MEP said: "UKIP would scrap the HS2 scheme immediately because it is a flawed EU vanity project and a national disgrace."

“It has no business case, as it will leave our country riddled with escalating debt. Never mind how many people’s lives and communities it will destroy, ripping up graveyards and ancient woodlands".

“I do not want to see our precious environment ruined by this destructive rail line,

“There are unanswered questions on plans and costs, yet it is still moving forward against public wishes. It will only be supporting a minority, at the expense of the majority.”

"How much money needs to be thrown at this until common sense prevails and HS2 is scrapped".

Mrs Seymour added: “What passengers want is an affordable, comfortable, reliable and efficient rail network system that delivers from south to north, and east to west.

“We already have a network in place, but it is desperate for improvement, alternative options have been offered at much less cost.

“The victims of HS2 are in total despair and have not been awarded adequate compensation.”
