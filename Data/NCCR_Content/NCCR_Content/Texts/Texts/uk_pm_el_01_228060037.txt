Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

A civilised country

Common sense means supporting the people that create a thriving culture

    Free arts organisations from dependence on the state by giving them endowments
    Back the tourism industry
    Privatise the commercially successful Channel Four
    Simplify regulation of British broadcasting and communications
    Support youth, grass roots and elite sport

Government policy towards the arts, sports and broadcasting has stumbled from fiasco to disaster in the last four years.

The Government wasted millions of pounds on bailing out the Dome, botched the development of Wembley stadium, dithered over the new UK Sports Institute, and supervised a bizarre competition to run the National Lottery only to end up handing it back to the existing firm.

This incompetence has been accompanied by a disdain for British traditions and a modish contempt for our heritage. Labour even promoted a bogus new culture - 'Cool Britannia' - in an attempt to supplant the culture and identity which has shaped us.

It's time for common sense.

A Conservative Government will be optimistic about Britain's future because we are comfortable with Britain's past.

"Tony Blair said that the Dome would be a vivid symbol of Labour’s Britain. That is exactly what it was. Step inside and you could be anywhere - it was banal, anonymous and rootless. It lacked a sense of Britain's history or culture."
