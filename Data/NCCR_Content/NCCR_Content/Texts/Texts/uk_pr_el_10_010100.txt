Press Release from Party: LibDem

Nick Clegg attacks Conservative spending plans

Thu, 08 Apr 2010

Speaking in Glasgow today, Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg will attack the Conservatives spending plans.

An extract from his speech is below:

Every Scottish person knows from the Poll Tax that you cannot trust the Conservatives on tax.

Your taxes will go up under the Conservatives, and heres why.

The Conservatives have made a series of tax promises in the last few years.

Tax breaks for millionaires with a 2m exemption from inheritance tax.

Tax breaks for married couples.

A freeze in Council Tax.

Reducing the impact of Labours proposed rises in National Insurance.

And another National Insurance tax break for small businesses.

Paying for all these tax promises would cost 13.5bn.

And the Conservatives have identified a paltry 100m of alternative tax revenue to pay for it.

Together with a series of vague and unconvincing statements about increased efficiency which David Cameron himself says are a trick.

It is time for the Conservatives to come clean about how they will pay for these tax cuts

Without decimating schools, hospitals and police forces across the country.
