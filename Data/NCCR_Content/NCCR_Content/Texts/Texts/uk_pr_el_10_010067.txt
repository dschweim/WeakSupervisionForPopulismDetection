Press Release from Party: LibDem

A fair deal for fare payers  Lib Dems pledge to cut rail fares

Sat, 27 Mar 2010

The Liberal Democrats have launched their manifesto pledge to cut rail fares in real terms.



Currently, regulated train fares are allowed to increase above inflation (RPI+1) every year. The plans would see this change to RPI-1, so that fares come down in real terms every year.

This would be achieved by offering train companies extensions on their existing franchises in exchange for cutting fares and by making it a pre-condition of any new franchise agreements. Where a franchise cannot be extended, the companies will be compensated for cutting fares.

The plans also include refunding passengers a third of the price of their ticket if they are forced to take a rail replacement bus at any point of their journey.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg said:

Passengers crammed onto commuter trains have been forced to pay inflation-busting fares year after year while train companies rake in multi-million pound profits.

Its time for passengers to come first.

The Liberal Democrats are the only party offering a fair deal for passengers.

Commenting further, Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary, Norman Baker added:

It is time the Government stopped this train fares escalator that is so unfair on passengers.

Labour has deliberately pushed up rail fares above inflation while the cost of driving and flying has come down.

This shows their commitment to the environment is only skin deep.

It is time to give a fair deal to fare payers.
