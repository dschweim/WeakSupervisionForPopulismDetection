Mixed-sex wards target failure proves Labour incompetence says Lamb

Wed, 31 Mar 2010

Its completely unacceptable that one in 20 Trusts has failed to meet a target that ministers must have thought was entirely achievable," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on todays Government announcement which reveals one in 20 hospital Trusts has failed to eliminate mixed-sex wards, Norman Lamb said:

This is yet another astonishing admission of Labours failure to fulfil a 13 year old manifesto commitment to eliminate mixed-sex wards.

Its completely unacceptable that one in 20 Trusts has failed to meet a target that ministers must have thought was entirely achievable.

Once again this Government has ducked real action on this issue. We were told that Trusts would be fined for failing to meet this target but instead they merely have to produce an action plan.

Labour may try and pretend todays announcement is a great triumph but in reality they have let down patients who rightly expect privacy and dignity when being treated by the NHS.
