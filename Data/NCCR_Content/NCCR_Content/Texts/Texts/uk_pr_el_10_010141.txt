Press Release from Party: LibDem

Liberal Democrats launch a fair deal for rural Britain

Tue, 20 Apr 2010

The Liberal Democrats have launched plans to give rural communities a fair deal.



The proposals will reform the tax system to promote affordable housing, create an independent food market regulator to ensure fair trade for British farmers and ensure Post Offices stay at the heart of community life.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg said:

The Liberal Democrats are proud to represent huge swathes of rural Britain. We want to protect the countryside, and make it a place people can afford to live and work, with access to reliable local services.

Sadly, too many local schools, hospitals and post offices are under pressure and many face closure.

House prices are expensive, driven up by second home owners while local people cant afford a home of their own, public transport is often non-existent, and supermarkets are giving farmers and shoppers a raw deal.

The Liberal Democrats want to make sure that people who live in the countryside get a fair deal.

Weve published a manifesto full of new ideas to provide affordable homes for local people; keep post offices open; give local people a say on bus fares and routes in their area; and stop big food companies from bullying farmers and shoppers.
