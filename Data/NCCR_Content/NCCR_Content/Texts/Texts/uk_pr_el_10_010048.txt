Labour and Tories failed to back lobbying reform says Heath

Mon, 22 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrats brought forward measures to restrict the influence of lobbyists in Parliament. Sadly, Labour voted them down while the Tories failed to show up," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Leader of the House.

Commenting on claims that former Government ministers have offered to influence policy for cash, David Heath said:

MPs should not be using their positions to further their own interests over those of the people they should be representing.

Liberal Democrats brought forward measures to restrict the influence of lobbyists in Parliament. Sadly, Labour voted them down while the Tories failed to show up.

Labour and the Tories claim they want to clean up politics but the reality proves different.

Once again it seems the Government and the Tories will say one thing while the truth reveals another.
