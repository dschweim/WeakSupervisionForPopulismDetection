SNP champions needed to protect recovery
Wed, 21/04/2010 - 15:17

Commenting on the official statistics which show that Scotland has moved out of recession, the SNPs Treasury spokesperson and election campaign co-ordinator, Stewart Hosie, said:

This is very welcome news and highlights how Scotland has been more resilient than the rest of the UK during Labour's Downing Street downturn. Scotland entered recession a full quarter after the UK and these figures show we have been in recession for less time than the UK.

Theres no doubt that Scotland has taken a severe hit during the economic downturn and recession but, these statistics show that the Scottish Governments Economic Recovery Plan has helped Scotland weather the storm better than those parts of the UK run by the Labour party.

What Scotland needs now are local and national champions to ensure that economic recovery continues and isnt hindered by the cuts planned by the London-based parties.

More than ever Scotland needs SNP MPs to protect Scotlands recovery from the London parties cuts. In this election more votes for the SNP means More Nats, and More Nats will mean Less Cuts, protecting Scotlands recovery.
