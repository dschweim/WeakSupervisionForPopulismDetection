Fri, 10/04/2015 - 17:09

Commenting after the campaign visit by Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls to Edinburgh today, SNP Depute Leader Stewart Hosie said:

"The SNP's message to Ed Miliband and Ed Balls is 'haste ye back' - they are a very big part of the reason for Labour's decline in the polls in Scotland. They represent the Westminster establishment - who were joined at the hip with the Tories in the referendum - that the people of Scotland want an alternative to.

"We have the extraordinary situation of a Labour leader being even more unpopular in Scotland than a Tory Prime Minister - and a Scottish Labour leader who the polls show did even less well in a debate than a Scottish Tory leader.

"And Ed Balls is the Shadow Chancellor who committed the Labour Party to Tory austerity cuts, which is their key weakness in this campaign.

"People are moving to the SNP because they want a real alternative, and a strong voice for Scotland at Westminster."

Today's YouGov poll shows the net satisfaction ratings as follows:
Nicola Sturgeon: +48
Ed Miliband: -46
David Cameron: -25
Jim Murphy: -18

And of those who watched the two-hour STV debate on Tuesday, the winner was
judged as follows in the YouGov poll:
Nicola Sturgeon: 56%
Ruth Davidson: 14%
Jim Murphy: 13%
Willie Rennie: 1%

44% of Labour voters said Jim Murphy was the winner, while 88% of SNP voters judged Nicola Sturgeon best.
