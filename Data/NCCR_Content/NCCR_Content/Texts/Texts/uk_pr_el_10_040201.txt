Colonisation: One Million More Immigrants by 2015 as 113 Parliament Seat Outcomes already Determined by Third World-Origin Voters
May 3, 2010 - By BNP News

A report from MigrationWatch UK has warned that Britains migrant population will swell by another million by 2015  while no less than 113 Parliamentary seats already have more Third World-origin voters than the incumbent MPs winning majorities.

According to the report, the number of people living in Britain will grow from 62.2 million to 64.3 million between now and 2015.

More than half of that growth will be caused by immigration, taking into account both people who move to Britain from overseas and babies born to migrants, Migrationwatch UK says.

The findings are based on projections by the Office for National Statistics, using current trends in migration and birth rates.

A separate report issued by the taxpayer-funded Operation Black Vote (OBV) organisation has said that there are 113 seats in Britain where the Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) voting-age population is bigger than the 2005 notional majority.

The OBV report claims that many of these seats could be won or lost by BME voters.

Some of the seats highlighted by OBV are listed below, along with the incumbents majority compared to the number of BME voters.
