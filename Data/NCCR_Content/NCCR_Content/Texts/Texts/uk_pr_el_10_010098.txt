Brown tax pledge a lame gesture says Cable

Wed, 07 Apr 2010

"If you want a fairer tax system that puts money back in the pockets of millions of people," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on Gordon Browns pledge to maintain the 20p tax rate, Vince Cable said:

This is a lame gesture. If you want a fairer tax system that puts money back in the pockets of millions of people, the only party that will do that is the Liberal Democrats.
