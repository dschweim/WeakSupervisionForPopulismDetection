-------------
Today I have pledged that a future Labour government will offer families the right to overturn convictions of gay men prosecuted under historic indecency laws. This law will be known as Turings Law in memory of Alan Turing  the Enigma code-breaker  who was convicted of gross indecency' in 1952 and has subsequently received a posthumous Royal Pardon.  What was right for Alan Turing's family should be right for other families as well. Its time we righted this historic injustice.
