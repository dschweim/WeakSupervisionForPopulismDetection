Today I set out the four objectives at the heart of our EU renegotiation. We need action in all four areas.

Objective one: protect the single market for Britain and others outside the Eurozone. What I mean by that is a set of binding principles that guarantee fairness between Euro and non-Euro countries.

Objective two: write competitiveness into the DNA of the whole European Union. And this includes cutting the total burden on business.

Objective three: exempt Britain from an “ever closer union” and bolster national parliaments. Not through warm words but through legally binding and irreversible changes.

Objective four: tackle abuses of the right to free movement, and enable us to control migration from the European Union, in line with our manifesto.

The renegotiation is not mission impossible. I am confident that, with patience and goodwill, a deal can be done.

And that in doing so we can make Britain and the whole of Europe safer and more prosperous for generations to come.
