Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour & Tory plans would drive public finances into the ground says Cable

Thu, 01 Apr 2010

Labour and the Tories are as bad as each other," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the continuing debate over Tory plans to reverse National Insurance rises, Vince Cable said:

Labour and the Tories are as bad as each other.

Under both their plans, public finances would be driven into the ground.

Whether its for tax cuts or filling in the deficit hole, both parties seem to be in a competition to see who can come up with the least credible cuts.

While Labour resorts to sending home sick nurses, the Tories cant even tell you what departments their cuts will be made in.

The Liberal Democrats have an honest and credible plan to tackle the deficit and a fully costed tax plan to put 700 back in the pockets of average workers.
