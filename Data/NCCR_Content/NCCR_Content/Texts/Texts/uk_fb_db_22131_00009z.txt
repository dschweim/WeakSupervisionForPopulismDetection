First Corbyn and McDonnell wanted to impose an FTT on London, now in a cynical attempt to hide the truth they say they want an FTT across the globe. They are all over the place.

Any Financial Transaction Tax threatens the City of London’s pre-eminent position as a global financial centre. That’s a massive risk to our economy, and threatens the UK jobs market.

Do we want business to abandon London and the UK in favour of Hong Kong, New York, or Singapore? I don’t. It’s clear John McDonnell does and that would put people’s livelihoods here at risk.
