Party Manifesto: UKIP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

15 Culture &Restoring Britishness
UKIP believes in civic nationalism, which is open and inclusive to anyone who wishes to identify with Britain, regardless of ethnic or religious background. We reject the “blood and soil” ethnic nationalism of extremist parties. UKIP opposes multiculturalism and political correctness, and promotes uniculturalism - aiming to create a single British culture embracing all races and religions. UKIP will:· Recognise the numerous threats to British identity and culture· Restore British values, scrap quotas and political correctness and return to meritocratic principles· Create a ‘British Register’ of important UK companies, products and brands and amend the UK Takeover Code to safeguard theseusing set criteria, parliamentary approvals and/or conditions where necessary· Safeguard British weights and measures (the pint, the mile, etc) which have been undermined by the EU. UKIP will also provide proper support to the Royal Mail and the Post Office as a key British institution· Require UK schools to teach Britain’scontribution to the world, including British inventions and Britain’s role in fightingslavery and Nazism. All cultures, languages and traditions from around the British Isles will be celebrated
· Tackle extremist Islam by banning the burqa or veiled niqab in public buildings andcertain private buildings. UKIP will deport radical preachers calling for violence or the overthrow of democracy and reintroduce a proper Treason Act to prosecute British Citizens found guilty of attacks on the British people or armed forces. Religious school materials must not teach hatred of the western world and must be congruent with British values. Sharia courts must not override UK law· Create a new ‘Commonwealth Day’ public holiday and a new Commonwealth Centre at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich· Be fair to England by introducing an ‘English Parliament’ and ending the discriminatory Barnett formula which disadvantages English residents· Make St George’s Day a public holiday in England
