Press Release from Party: LibDem

Cameron happy for your vote not to count says Huhne

Mon, 26 Apr 2010

Hes happy for your vote not to count so that he can keep his MPs in safe seats tending to their moats and duck houses instead of the people they are supposed to represent," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on David Camerons description of Proportional Representation as a great con, Chris Huhne said:

David Cameron doesnt want change at all. Hes just another old-style politician making a grab for absolute power with just one in three of the votes.

Hes happy for your vote not to count so that he can keep his MPs in safe seats tending to their moats and duck houses instead of the people they are supposed to represent.
