Labours plans for Trident replacement look nonsensical says Davey

Fri, 26 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrats oppose like-for-like replacement of Trident. It is not suited to todays security threats and, with a 100bn price tag, it is a system we simply cannot afford," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Foreign Secretary.

Commenting on the announcement of a new US-Russia deal on reducing numbers of nuclear weapons, Edward Davey said:

This is an encouraging move ahead of international talks, which makes Labours determination to sign up to the like-for-like replacement of Trident look still more nonsensical.

With the US and the Russians cutting their nuclear stockpiles, Britain should not be committing to the renewal of an outdated, Cold War nuclear deterrent.
