Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

IranIn Iran, hundreds of thousands of citizens calling for democratic reforms are using newtechnologies to come together, coordinate their protests against the state, and communicatewith the outside world. The power of these information flows is growing rapidly. Every timethe Iranian state has tried to choke the flow of information to dampen down the protests, peoplehave turned to new technologies to share and access information. When the state cut off textmessaging services, protesters switched to social media like Twitter and Facebook. When foreignjournalists had their visas removed and had to leave the country, Iranians began to upload videoclips onto YouTube so that the government’s actions could continue to be scrutinised. And whenthe government tried to ban popular websites, private citizens outside Iran set up proxy internetservers so that Iranians could continue to access information.
