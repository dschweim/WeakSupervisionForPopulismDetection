-------------
At the start of this holy month I would like to wish Ramadan Mubarak to Muslims the world over, across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere.

Ramadan has been celebrated in the United Kingdom for generations, and we are proud of our strong ties to the Muslim world, from our traditional partnerships in the Middle East and strong historical links in Asia and Africa, to our vibrant community of British Muslims.

We are also conscious of the many people for whom this Ramadan will be a difficult time - those affected by conflict, displacement or poverty. Britain will continue to be a leading provider of humanitarian aid across the world, as part of our strong commitment to promoting international peace, security and prosperity.
