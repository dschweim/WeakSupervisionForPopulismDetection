Unelected lords begrudge even limited new powers

Commenting on the Constitution Committee (House of Lords) report on the implementation of the Smith Commission, SNP Westminster Leader Angus Robertson MP said:

“The Smith Commission’s recommendations were already underwhelming and were then watered down further by the UK government’s paper. Now we have unelected Lords being grudging about even these reduced powers.

“The Lords report concludes with a call for the UK Parliament to “not simply accept” more powers for Scotland.

“This follows on from a similar House of Commons report, and is the kind of out of touch approach that is doing such damage to all of the Westminster parties, and for which they may pay a heavy price for at the General Election.

"The debate in Scotland is about how to get maximum power in order to counter Westminster’s continued cuts programme – which both Labour and Tories have signed up to for the next parliament.

“The limited powers recommended by the Smith Commission do not live up to the pre-referendum rhetoric of the Vow from the Westminster parties.

“A strong team of SNP MPs in May will mean a strong voice for Scotland - to win the power promised for Scotland, reverse cuts in favour of investing in growth and jobs, and stop the waste of tens of billions of pounds on a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons."
