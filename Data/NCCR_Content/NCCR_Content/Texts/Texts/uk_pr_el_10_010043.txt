Press Release from Party: LibDem

Posturing and point scoring must end before strikes make passengers suffer

Fri, 19 Mar 2010

"Executives, unions and politicians need to start acting like grown ups and get this sorted before the public declares a plague on all their houses," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary.

Commenting on railway workers voting in favour of strike action, Norman Baker said:

In all the political mudslinging over who is to blame for strike action by BA or railway workers, it is the passengers who are suffering the most.
 
There is no need for any of these strikes to go ahead. Management at British Airways and Network Rail need to get back round the table with the unions to sort this mess out before peoples holiday, business and travel plans are ruined for no good reason.
 
There is far too much macho posturing and cheap political point scoring going on all sides of these disputes. Enough is enough. Executives, unions and politicians need to start acting like grown ups and get this sorted before the public declares a plague on all their houses.
