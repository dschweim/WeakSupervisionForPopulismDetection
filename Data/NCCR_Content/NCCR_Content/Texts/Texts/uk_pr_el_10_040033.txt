Press Release from Party: BNP

Iconic British Black Cab to be Built in China
March 19, 2010

The destruction of Britain under the Labour/Tory plan took yet another leap forward with the announcement that production of the iconic black cab will be moved to China.

The black cabs were made by Coventry-based companyManganese Bronze, which has now been bought by a Chinese company.

Maganese Bronze confirmed in a statement that the  manufacture of its TX4 black cab vehicles body panels and chassis will go to China following the change in ownership.

It said the parts for the TX4 vehicles will now be made in Shanghai following the decision of one of its suppliers to cease production of a specialist painting process.

The decision will cost an estimated 60 British workers their jobs and be yet another body blow to what remains of Britains once mighty car industry.

Manganese Bronze sells the bulk of its production to London based taxi companies, with the remainder being sold to cab operators in other major British cities.

These companies will soon have to source new vehicles and spares from China or Germany.

The company is reported as having made a pre-tax loss of over 8m last year, which came on top of a 6m loss in 2008.

Manganese Bronzes takeover by the Chinese follows the sale of Mini and Rolls-Royce to the Germans, Jaguar Land Rover to the Indians and Aston Martin to a Middle East-based concern.

It illustrates the hollowness of Gordon Browns aping of the British National Partys slogan: British jobs for British workers.

When we say it  we mean it.
