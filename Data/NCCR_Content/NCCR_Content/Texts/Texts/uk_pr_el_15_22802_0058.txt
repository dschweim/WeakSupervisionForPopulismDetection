    The Tories are taking the British public for granted  - Douglas Alexander

    Douglas Alexander MP, Labour’s Chair of General Election Strategy, said:

    “The Tories are taking the British public for granted.

    “It is typically arrogant of David Cameron to presume a third Tory term in 2020 before the British public have been given the chance to have their say in this election. In the UK it is for the British people and not the Prime Minister to decide who stays in power.

    "Instead of focusing on themselves, it is time we had a Government focused on the needs of working families. Another term of this Government would mean working people worse off and the NHS under threat because of their extreme spending plans. We need a better plan for a better future. We need a Labour government.”
