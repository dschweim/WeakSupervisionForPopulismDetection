Your vote can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP
Post date: 03/05/2015

With polls predicting wipeout for Labour in Scotland, Ed Miliband needs the SNP to get into No10.

They'll hold him to ransom - demanding more debt, more borrowing and more taxes - and you'll pay for it.

Vote Conservative today to stop them, and SHARE this to let friends know.
