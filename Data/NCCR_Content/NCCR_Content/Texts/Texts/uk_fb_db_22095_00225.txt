Going out for a drink tonight with our ex-landlord Eli, a Jewish businessman, who has become my friend. I can't help remembering how Yeshua, Eli's champion Messiah gave us $1,480,000 last year so we could buy our building from Eli & his partner Bill. What a glorious day that was! Including two checks from anonymous donors - one for $1,200,000 and the other for $100,000. We bought the building cash with $80,000 left over and closed 2 months early! How good is God!!! We give Him all the glory!
