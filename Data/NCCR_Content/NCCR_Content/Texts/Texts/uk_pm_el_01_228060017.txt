Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Growing older

Common sense means respect and independence for older people

    Cut taxes for pensioners
    Increase the basic state pension
    Abolish compulsory annuities at age 75
    Allow younger workers to opt for properly funded private pensions
    Protect the savings and homes of those needing long term care

Older people are among our most responsible citizens and give a great deal to their communities, but they have been demeaned and patronised by this Government. They resent being seen as a burden. And they fear they do not have a place in Blair's Cool Britannia.

To be able to have the standard of living to which they are entitled, Britain's pensioners now have to apply to the Statefor special favours. When Labour came into office, 37 per cent of pensioners had to take the means test in order to get their benefit entitlement. On Labour's current plans, within two years most pensioners - 57 per cent - will have to apply to the State for help in this undignified and intrusive way.

Pensioners are proud of being able to take responsibility for themselves, but Labour has denied them this dignity. Instead they have taxed pensioners more heavily and driven them on to means-tested benefits.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will give pensioners greater independence from the State, by cutting taxes, removing a million pensioners from income tax altogether, and by increasing the basic state pension - with no strings attached.

"We will abolish the rule which currently forces pensioners to buy an annuity when they reach 75."
