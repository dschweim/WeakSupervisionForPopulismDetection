Transport: Getting Britain Moving Again
• The BNP will make rail travel affordable once again by reversing the disastrousprivatisation process which has grossly inflated ticket prices.• The BNP will reduce traffic congestion by bringing the immigration invasionunder control.• The BNP will invest in a high speed 200 mph magnetic levitation inter-cityrail network.• The BNP will seek to decrease the price of fuel which is already comprised of atleast 63 percent government tax.• The BNP will charge foreign trucks for the right to use Britain’s road network, asother European nations already do.• The BNP will encourage and support the development of alternative transportationtechnologies to ultimately replace the internal combustion engine.The Need for State Investment in the Transport InfrastructureThe size of investment needed to upgrade and maintain the transportation sector means that the state must be involved in the process as profit-driven private sector exclusivity will make it too expensive for consumers to use.This fact is illustrated by the disastrous consequences of the rail network privatisation — it is now cheaper to fly from London to New York than it is to take a train from Manchester to London at peak times. It is little wonder that the roads are congested.Increased investment is required in Britain’s public transport system to bring it up to the highest standards in the world and to help relieve the chronic congestion on our road network.Elsewhere, such as certain South Coast routes, travelling times are slower than at any time since before WWI.The BNP therefore doubts the merits of rail privatisation, with different companies running monopoly services and tracks — and all still ultimately dependent upon public subsidies, despite paying profits to private shareholders.New Technologies and New DevelopmentBritain’s railways require substantial investment. The introduction of super-efficient Maglev trains will become a national transport priority.Transport projects should be designed in sympathy with the landscape and therefore utilise road tunnels where appropriate.Traffic congestion, especially in South East England, is the result of overcrowding, immigration and ‘white flight’ from the cities and conurbations.Our policies to cease immigration and encourage repatriation will have a beneficial respect in terms of congestion.The BNP will:- Seek to abolish the road fund licence. It is expensive to administer and susceptible to evasion. The road fund must be supported out of the taxation raised on fuel, which will make it more equitable in relation to road usage.Inhabitants of rural areas who have further to drive will be compensated by central government grants to county councils for council tax reductions.- According to the Association of British Motorists, 63 percent of the fuel price is comprised of Government tax. The BNP will endeavour to reduce this burden after making expenditure cuts outlined in the economy section of this document.- Call a moratorium on out-of-town retail developments. They encourage car dependence, increase congestion, disadvantage the high street, pensioners, single mothers and the poor. Future developments must concentrate on brown-field sites, linked by public transport.- Free motorists from repressive and restrictive legislation. Overall motorway speed limits will be raised to 90mph, subject to surface/weather conditions and traffic volume.- Maintain toll free motorways.- Cease the persecution of motorists by phasing out speed cameras except for documented accident black spots.- Introduce a new licence for foreign trucks whereby they will pay in respect of their use of British transport routes. Such a policy is already in force in Switzerland.- Develop new transport technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells.- Maintain and upgrade our waterways to transport freight.- Reopen disused rail lines, closed under the Beaching closures, where there is local demand and with a view to easing congestion.
