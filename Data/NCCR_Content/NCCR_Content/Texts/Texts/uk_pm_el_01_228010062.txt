Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Defence and International Institutions

International

Britain can achieve far more by working with others than working alone. An internationalist approach is the best way to protect our freedom and our interests as. We will work to build effective international and regional organisations to promote peace and freedom throughout the world, combat poverty and disease and tackle global environmental problems.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Promote a foreign policy based on democracy, human rights and good governance

    Seek to make international institutions more able to address global security, trade and environmental issues

    Resist further erosion of Britain’s defence capability while co-operating more closely with the country’s allies

Events in one nation can have a profound impact on life in other countries. The world is no longer one of self-contained nation states. Britain has too often given aid and comfort to authoritarian regimes which oppress their people and threaten world stability. And as Britain’s own defence capability has weakened, the country has been slow to pool resources with its allies.
