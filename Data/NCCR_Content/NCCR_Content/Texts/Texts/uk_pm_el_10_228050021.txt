climate change
The canary in the mineMiners used to take canaries down mineswith them to check for poisonous gases.They were an advance warning of impendingproblems. That’s what climate change is today– a threat in itself to our survival as a speciesand a warning of more general ecologicalcollapse. The evidence from Copenhagensuggests that mainstream governments justhaven’t grasped the nature and scale of thechanges that need to be made, from massiveinvestments in energy saving, to greentechnologies and infrastructure, to transfersof funds to developing countries.Human-made climate change is anunprecedentedly serious threat to our welfare.But only the Green Party understands that thisis just one sign of the stress our economiesand lifestyles put on the environment.Other political parties will have you believethat it’s just an isolated problem. But it’s not.It’s a sign of what’s to come unless we getour planetary home in order.We know that every person, every community,every country has a carbon footprint thatcontributes to climate change. And we knowthat those with big footprints – the wealthyand those with extravagant lifestyles –have to make them smaller.But carbon isn’t the only footprint we have.We have water footprints, and other footprintstoo. Added together, these differentfootprints add up to our total ecologicalimpact – and it mustn’t be bigger than theplanet we live on.Today, though, the scale ofeconomic activity has taken us dangerouslybeyond what the planet can bear if it is tocontinue to support flourishing human andother life, and population growth onlymakes things worse.
