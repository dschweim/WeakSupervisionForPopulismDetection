Press Release from Party: SNP

Voters backing a balanced parliament
Wed, 14/04/2010 - 16:15

More voters are backing a balanced Parliament than want to see either Labour or the Tories in Government, a poll has revealed.

The Populus poll for the Times reflects the level to which voters are dissatisfied with all the London parties and are looking for an alternative. It shows 32% of people back a balanced Parliament  more than support each of the UK parties forming a Government.

Commenting on the results SNP Westminster Leader Angus Robertson said:

A balanced Parliament offers real opportunity to voters in Scotland and Wales and is now the most popular choice amongst voters looking for an alternative to the London party machine.

Labour and Tory efforts to frighten the public have failed as across the UK they reject the false promises and phoney war of the metropolitan parties and look toward a fresh start for politics.

In a balanced parliament a Celtic  Alliance of the SNP and Plaid Cymru will see Scotlands voice and Scotlands views placed at the heart of Westminsters decisions.

With the three London parties offering an agenda of cuts, cuts and more cuts, its no surprise voters across the UK are searching for an alternative.

At this election a strong bloc of SNP and Plaid MPs, using our votes and influence to win vital concessions, can protect Scotland and Wales.
