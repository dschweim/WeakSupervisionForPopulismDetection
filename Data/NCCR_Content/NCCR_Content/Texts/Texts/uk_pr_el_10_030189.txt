Press Release from Party: SNP

Poll: SNP surge as London parties slump
Wed, 05/05/2010 - 09:30

The final poll of the campaign, showing voting intention data from
PoliticsHome and YouGov across the nations and regions of the UK, shows a
strong surge in SNP support as all the other parties lose ground going
into polling day.

The poll, with a Scottish sample size of 1,141 over the last week,
shows the SNP pulling away in clear second place in Scotland on 25 per
cent - up seven points on the party's 2005 Westminster result and the
SNP's highest YouGov rating since early March. Labour are on 37 per
cent, the LibDems on 22 and the Tories 14.

If the findings were repeated at the polls it would make the SNP
the only party to increase its support on the last election, putting the
party on track for its largest share of the vote in a Westminster
contest in 36 years.

Welcoming the findings, SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson
said:

"This is a hugely encouraging final day's poll for the
SNP as we go into the last full day of campaigning.

"We are the
only party with our ratings going up while all the London parties are
seeing their support slump as people across Scotland turn against the
cosy Westminster consensus they represent.

"Labour are finished, the Tories are flat-lining in Scotland and
the Lib Dems are going into reverse.

"We will be campaigning
hard across Scotland in the countdown to the polls opening as we look to
turn this surge into votes and seats for SNP local and national
champions."
