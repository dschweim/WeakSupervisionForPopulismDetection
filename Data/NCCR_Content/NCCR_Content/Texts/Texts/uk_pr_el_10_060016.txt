NHS managers increasing five times as fast as nurses

Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has reacted to figures showing that the number of managers in the NHS is now increasing more than five times as fast as the number of nurses.

"Yet again funds that are urgently needed for the frontline are being swallowed up by Labours bureaucratic black hole", Lansley said.

Newly-published NHS workforce statistics show that:

    Between 2008 and 2009 the number of NHS managers increased more than five times as fast as the number of nurses.
    The number of NHS managers has increased almost three times as fast as the number of nurses over the past decade.
    The total number of NHS administrative staff has increased by 63 per cent over the past decade from 17 per cent of total NHS staff to 21 per cent.

"The day after Labour said the NHS needs to be more efficient we see that box-ticking and bureaucracy still seems to be more important to them than caring for patients", Lansley said.

"NHS funds are precious and now, more than ever, taxpayers are looking to the Government to spend them on the things that really matter."
