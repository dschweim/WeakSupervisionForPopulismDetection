Party Manifesto: BNP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

Education fora British Future
* The BNP will reverse the budget cuts on education and prioritise this sector as vitalto the rebuilding of our nation.* The BNP will bring back traditional syllabi and teaching methods to replace the |current and obviously failed systems currently being used.* The BNP will bring back streaming and grammar schools.* The BNP will bring back academic and sporting competition at all levelsof education.* The BNP will offer free university education to deserving students who havecompleted their period of Community Service.Reversing the Destruction of Britain’s Educational SystemThe BNP opposes trendy egalitarian teaching methods that have made Britain one of the most poorly educated nations in Europe, with particularly low standards of literacy.Untold damage has been wrought on our nation and to an entire generation whose average level of attainment is now lower than before the introduction of universal state education.Different individuals are born with differing abilities and aptitudes. All are entitled to the same opportunity to realise their potential, but this cannot occur by forcing them all into a low-grade ‘one-size-fits-all’ education system.Dismal educational standards prompt economic decline, incivility, cultural decay and inequality.We shall rebuild the entire educational system to ensure that no child is unable to realise his or her potential.We shall reintroduce emphasis on the ‘Three Rs’, especially at elementary level and we shall return to the system of learning by phonetics.The left has deliberately employed the educational system as an instrument of social engineering and indoctrination.It is hardly surprising, therefore, that British history is rarely taught in schools or that many teachers regard history as a subject to be avoided because it encourages patriotism.We shall also return authority to teachers and headmasters and place greater emphasis on training young people in the industrial and technological skills required by the modern world.As we state within our section under the Economy, our country lacks engineers and scientists. These and other skills, which have been permitted to decline, will be invigorated under our policies.We shall offer generous subsidies to students — both in terms of their coursework andaccommodation — who embark upon such study.We shall reappraise the notion of student tuition fees with a view to their abolition.We shall create apprenticeships, especially in manufacturing industry.We will instil in our young people knowledge and pride in their British history, traditions, identity and origins.Key Policies on Primary and Secondary Schooling- The egalitarian, anti-British dogmas that have dominated the educational system for a generation will be replaced with a commitment to competition, excellence and the preservation of British culture.- We will reopen the grammar schools and allow communities the right to choose their introduction, where these schools are absent. Equally, we support the principle of streaming in all schools, so that the most able are allowed to find their natural level. To this extent, we expect to raise the standard of learning to those available within the grammar schools.- We shall restore ‘A’ and ‘O’ Levels and public, university and employer confidence in these examinations.- We shall reverse the dumbing-down of the school curricula and raise expectations to the levels of the past.- We shall emphasise British history along with English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish culture and their relation to Western Civilization as a whole.- We shall gradually eliminate bureaucracy in schools and reallocate the saving in salaries to the hiring of teachers and the purchase of textbooks and learning materials.- We shall eliminate politically correct subjects and reallocate funding and the time of pupils to traditional subjects like reading, writing, and maths.- We shall promote a meritocracy in education, so that pupils from all backgrounds may rise as far as their abilities take them. We will prohibit the promotion of an expectation of failure for working-class pupils, which blighted the educational prospects of many children in earlier generations.- We shall reopen the special needs schools, closed for reasons of egalitarian dogma. Placing such children in conventional schools, where they are unable to cope, also compromises the education of the children within those schools.- In recognition that especially gifted children have special needs, we would make available additional resources to enable them to attain their potential.- Exclusion policies shall be returned to the hands of head teachers and governors, instead of bureaucrats. We shall also hold parents to account for persistently unruly children.- We shall examine downsizing of council educational authorities and the reallocation of their funding to local schools.- Competition shall be reintroduced and encouraged at all levels of the educational system, including sport. Competitive sport teaches espirit de corps, teamwork, and social interaction along with promoting good health. We similarly attach great value on vocational skills and training.- We shall require all schools to provide traditional well-balanced meals, using locally-sourced ingredients wherever possible. We note that schools are an ideal outlet for the less than visually perfect fruit and vegetables produced by farmers which supermarkets claim cannot be sold.- We shall re-introduce assemblies based on traditional Christian values and worship as a benchmark for a decent and stable society.- We shall encourage parental involvement across the educational system.Key Policies on University EducationThe BNP’s ambition is to make a good high-school education sufficient for many careers, eliminating the need for expensive and worthless university degrees where they are not required.The systemic disregard by successive Tory and Labour regimes for the creation of an educational system that trains people for jobs is nowhere better illustrated than in terms of the nonsensical degrees that are regularly churned out in universities.Courses such as ‘beach management,’ ‘golf-course management,’ and ‘game keeping,’ which were once properly learned in apprenticeships, are now widely available in universities.Politically correct degrees have also proliferated and while they may be of use to ‘equalities’ minded left-leaning councils, they are of little use to the productive economy. We shall withdraw subsidies in universities for such degrees.If there remains a demand for these courses, then the marketplace will determine the price and the establishment which offers them.In addition, the BNP will:- Require ideological balance in university faculties, previously a domain of the left.- Abolish the Fair Access Regulator and other politically correct attempts to undermine university standards in the name of social levelling.- On satisfactory completion of their period of National Service, all suitably qualified youngsters will become eligible to receive a fully funded university education. The less academically qualified will be entitled to paid apprenticeships or training.- We shall therefore scrap targets in terms of which a predefined number of school leavers have to be university educated. This has been one of the primary causes of the growth in “useless degrees” and will necessitate the re-designation of a number of universities back into vocational colleges.- We shall increase funding for areas of value to the nation, such as technology, science, engineering and traditional culture. We believe higher education must serve both our economy and the maintenance of our culture and national identity.- We shall introduce bursaries to encourage students to study difficult, unpopular or lengthy subjects that fall within the national interest.- We shall fund industrial laboratories and other means by which university research is useful to industry, science and medicine.
