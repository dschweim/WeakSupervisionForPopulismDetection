Chief exec pay increase a slap in the face to NHS staff says Lamb

Sun, 11 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrats will put a cap on pay in the NHS to ensure that no chief executive earns more than the Prime Minister," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on reports that NHS chief executives pay increased at more than twice the rate of nurses pay last year, Norman Lamb said:

This is totally unacceptable. There is simply no justification for chief executives to receive pay increases that are far larger than those for frontline nursing staff.

Many nurses are struggling to get by and this will be seen as slap in the face to hardworking NHS staff who are having to accept pay restraint in the current financial climate.

Labour has overseen the emergence of fat cats in the NHS and throughout the public sector. This financially draining culture has got to change.

Liberal Democrats will put a cap on pay in the NHS to ensure that no chief executive earns more than the Prime Minister.
