Soaring inflation bad news for families feeling the pinch
Tuesday, April 20 2010
Philip Hammond

Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Philip Hammond has responded to official figures showing inflation jumped to 3.4% in March.

"This is worrying news for families who are already feeling the pinch", he said.

"Gordon Brown's decision to freeze tax allowances while inflation is soaring means that people will pay more of their income in tax  the last thing they need when they are already struggling to balance their budgets."

The figures from the Office of National Statistics show that CPI is up 3.4% and RPI up 4.4% on a year earlier.

Hammond added that only a decisive Conservative victory at the election could restore confidence in the economy.

"A hung Parliament could lead to an even weaker pound and even higher inflation, with the risk of higher interest rates to tackle it", he said.

"Only the Conservatives can restore confidence in our economy and guarantee the recovery."
