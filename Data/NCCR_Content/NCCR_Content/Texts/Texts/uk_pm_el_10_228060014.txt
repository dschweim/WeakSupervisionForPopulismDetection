change the economy | REFORM PUBLIC SERVICES TO DELIVERBETTER VALUE FOR MONEY

Reform public services to deliver better value for money
We will raise productivity growth in the public sector in order to deliver better schoolsand a better NHS.

Public sector productivity has fallen underLabour, acting as a drag on growth andreducing the quality of our public services.If productivity in the public sector had grownat the same rate as in private sector services,we could now have the same quality of publicservices for £60 billion less each year. So, byimproving public sector productivity whilegetting a grip on the debt, we will still beable to deliver better public services. Thatis why good government costs less with theConservatives.
Decentralisation, accountabilityand transparencyWe value the work of those employed inour public services, and a Conservativegovernment will work with them to deliverhigher productivity and better value formoney for taxpayers. We will raise publicsector productivity by increasing diversity ofprovision, extending payment by results andgiving more power to consumers.Giving public sector workers ownership of theservices they deliver is a powerful way to driveefficiency, so we will support co-operatives andmutualisation as a way of transferring publicassets and revenue streams to public sector
