Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

• not permit any commercial planting of GMcrops until and unless it has been assessed assafe for people and the environment; and,• develop a legally-binding protocol coveringthe separation of GM and non-GM material,including clear industry liability.We will negotiate for further reform of theCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) to delivergreater value for money while supporting thesustainability of British farming. The new CAPshould reflect the importance we attach to theenvironment, to ensuring food security andto tackling global poverty. We advocate thedismantling of market-distorting subsidies ata pace that allows time for British farmers andproducers in developing countries to adapt. Wewill minimise and reform on-farm inspections,and abolish the Agricultural Wages Board.The most pressing animal health problem in theUK today is bovine tuberculosis (bTB), whichhas led to the slaughter of over 250,000 cattlesince 1997. As part of a package of measures,we will introduce a carefully-managed andscience-led policy of badger control in areaswith high and persistent levels of bTB .Government should take the lead by procuringmore sustainably. We will ensure that foodprocured by government departments, andeventually the whole public sector, meets Britishstandards of production, wherever this can beachieved without increasing overall costs.We will introduce honesty in food labelling, ifnecessary through legislation, so consumerscan be confident about where their food comesfrom. This will ensure that meat labelled as‘British’ is born and bred in Britain, and raisedto our high welfare standards. And we willpromote local food networks so that homesand businesses can obtain supplies of locallyproducedfood.We will ensure a fair market for food suppliers– especially farmers – by reducing theburden of regulation. To ensure the grocerysupply code of practice is applied fairly, wewill introduce an independent supermarketombudsman.Use natural resourcesresponsiblyWe will introduce a Responsibility Deal onwaste – a voluntary arrangement amongproducers to cut back on the production ofwaste and improve its disposal – as we movetowards our goal of a zero-waste society.Households need new incentives to go green,so we will reward people who do the rightthing by encouraging councils to pay peopleto recycle, while scrapping Labour’s plans fornew bin taxes on families. To help this happen,we will put a floor under the standard rate oflandfill tax until 2020 to encourage alternativeforms of waste disposal.

With a rising population and growing strainson our water supply, industry and customersalike need new incentives to conserve water.We will reform the water industry, and bringin new measures to encourage businesses andhouseholds to value this precious resourcemore highly, and protect poorer householdsfrom excessive rises in water bills.To cope with the increased risk of floodingassociated with climate change, we willtake forward the findings of the Pitt Reviewto improve our flood defences, preventunnecessary building in areas of high floodrisk, and ensure the country is betterequipped when flooding does take place.
