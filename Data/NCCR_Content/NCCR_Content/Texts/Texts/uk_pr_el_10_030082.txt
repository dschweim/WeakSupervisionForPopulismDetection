Press Release from Party: SNP

Former Labour MPs' challenged on legal aid
Tue, 13/04/2010 - 10:53

The SNP today challenged the scandal-hit Labour ex-MP Jim Devine, and his two Labour colleagues Elliot Morley and David Chaytor, to refuse the legal aid they have been granted.

The three have been charged over the Westminster expenses scandal and have proceeded to apply for taxpayers cash to fund their defence.

Commenting, an SNP spokesperson said:
This is the final insult to the public.

It is a disgrace that these former MPs applied for taxpayers cash in the first place, never mind being granted it.

When the country is still suffering the effects of Gordon Browns Downing Street downturn and both Labour and the Tories are threatening savage cuts to public services, the last thing ordinary people should be asked to do is fund disgraced politicians legal bills.

Jim Devine and his two Labour colleagues need to now publicly come out and refuse this raid on the taxpayer.
