The Home Office has given a Muslim police support group 15 times more  taxpayer funded handouts than that given to Christian equivalents  proving once again that the ruling elite puts the interests of British people last.

The Christian Police Association (CPA) has been given 15,000 over the past five years while the National Association of Muslim Police (NAMP) was paid 90,000 in the past two years alone, according to Home Office figures.

The Home Office claims that the CPA received an average of 3,000 a year while the NAMP received 45,000 a year. Both organisations have about 2000 members.

The NAMP received general funding of 90,000 over the past two years:45,000 from 2008/9 and another 45,000 from 2009/10.

The CPA was given general funding of 5,000 in 2004/5 and 10,000 in 2009/10.

According to media reports, Don Axcell, executive director of the CPA, said repeated requests for additional funding had been ignored. He also disputed the Home Office figures, saying that his organisation had been paid even less, only receiving 10,000 in 2009.

According to the NAMP website, that organisation was set up to represent the interest of Muslim officers and staff within the police service and its mission statement is Muslims making a Difference to Policing.

The organisation says that its key objectives are to create a support network (whatever that may be) and increase trust /confidence and improve community cohesion while raising Islamic Awareness and dealing with Equality issues such as Islamophobia.

The NAMP has, therefore, an overtly political agenda which is designed to raise Islamic awareness.

In contrast, the CPA website says that its mission is to encourage and support Christians in the Police Service; communicate in words and action, the truth, message and hope of the gospel of Jesus Christ to colleagues and the community we serve; (and) build bridges between the Christian community and the police.

There is, therefore, no overtly political agenda to the CPA, as it should be. This will also explain why the anti-British ruling elite have favoured the NAMP over the CPA  with your tax money.
