Shadow Justice Secretary Dominic Grieve responds to official figures on Labour's controversial early release scheme.

"At this election, there is a clear choice", he said.

"Five more years of a Labour government which released 80,000 prisoners early; the Liberal Democrats, who would let up to 60,000 offenders walk free; or change under a Conservative Government that will reform our failing prison system to bring down re-offending and cut crime."

The final statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that:

    81,578 offenders were released early under the scheme in total.16,334 of these offenders were serving sentences for violence against the person
    2,108 were serving sentences for robbery and 7,504 for burglary
    1,234 offenders were reported for alleged re-offending while on early release
    1,624 alleged offences were committed by offenders on early release
    125 offenders recalled for alleged re-offending or breaching the terms of their early release are still at large.
