Liberal Democrats back green stimulus package

Sun, 14 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrat Spring Conference today backed plans to rebalance the economy and create thousands of new green jobs.

The plans will play a vital part in a fair recovery that locks in investment and ensures a path of low-carbon growth.

The plans for a green economic stimulus package are a core part of the Liberal Democrat election manifesto and include:

        Immediate investment to expand our green energy infrastructure

        Bringing hundreds of thousands of empty homes back into use

        Insulating schools and other public buildings

        An eco-cashback scheme to reward people who make energy efficiency improvements in their homes

        A National Infrastructure Bank to promote long-term investment in sustainable public transport and renewable energy

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary Simon Hughes said:

The Liberal Democrats have set out a blueprint for a fair economy thats fit to last.

A green stimulus package will help boost investment in clean energy, reduce fuel bills and create thousands of new jobs.

Labour and the Tories cant be trusted to deliver the green growth we need.

Only the Liberal Democrats have bold and credible plans to rebalance the economy and put Britain at the forefront of this vital transition.
