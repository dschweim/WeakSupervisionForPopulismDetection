Press Release from Party: SNP

Seismic votes shift in Scottish politics
Sat, 20/03/2010 - 10:14

As the SNP opens its spring conference in Aviemore and the party's candidates, MPs, MSPs and councillors work hard to support their communities and champion their concerns, new research shows that voters have backed the SNP in increasing numbers since the 2005 election.

The research, which looks at all elections in Scotland since the last Westminster campaign in 2005 shows the seismic shift that has taken place in Scottish politics with 135,00 more votes cast since 2005 for the SNP than any other party in Scotland.

Of the 7.4 million votes cast in Scotland since the last Westminster election the SNP earned the support of 31% or 2.3 million votes with Labour receiving only 2.17 million (29%) votes.

Speaking ahead of the conference gathering SNP Business Convener and Stirling MSP Bruce Crawford said the party was on a firm footing to fight the coming election campaign.

At the last two major elections and over the last five years Scotlands voters have rejected the metropolitan politicians machine in favour of local candidates who will champion their concerns.

As Scotlands party we go into this campaign with that same promise to voters that as local and national champions we will put their interests first.

"The SNP is going into conference and into the General Election campaign from our strongest ever point as we continue to work hard to earn the support of the people of Scotland.

At conference we will set out key areas where local SNP candidates and MPs will fight for Scotlands and their constituents interests  on fair fuel prices, on protecting Scotland from Labour and Tory cuts, supporting our businesses and ensuring we can access the resources to create thousands of new jobs across our nation.

Importantly our local representatives will be listening to Scotlands people to work alongside them and champion their causes, not lecturing or deciding for them.

Commenting on the change in Scottish politics over the last five years Mr Crawford added:

There has been a seismic shift in Scottish politics. Voters are no longer faced with the one party machine favoured by the politicians inWestminster.  Over the last five years Scotlands voters made their choice clear, they have rejected typical London politicians and voted for something different with the SNP in Holyrood, in Europe and in their communities.

As Scotland faces another election the Westminster expenses scandals, bankers bonuses and illegal wars have all taken their toll on a tolerant public.  Voters have watched banks be bailed out while the victims of Farepack and Globespan struggled to reclaim a penny and local services are forced to come to terms with 800 million of Westminster cuts.

At this election there is a real opportunity for Scottish voters to not just elect another Westminster politician who will serve themselves instead of serving the community but to elect a local and national champion who will always put their interests first.
