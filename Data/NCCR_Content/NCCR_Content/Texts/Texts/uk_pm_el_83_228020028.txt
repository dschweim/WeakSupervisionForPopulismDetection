Party Manifesto: Lab (uk) - National Elections 1983
-------------------------------------

Devolution to Scotland

Labour is determined to decentralise power in decision-making. In Scotland, the people have shown their support for devolution in a referendum and at successive general elections; and we have set out our proposals for devolution in a major statement, Scotland and Devolution. Labour will:

    Establish a directly elected Scottish Assembly, with an executive drawn from members of the assembly.
    Provide the Assembly with legislative and executive powers over a wide range of domestic policy, including matters such as health, education and social welfare.
    Ensure a major role for the Assembly in assisting in the regeneration of Scottish industry - including the preparation and implementation of a Plan for Scotland - within the context of our overall national plan.
    As well as receiving grants from central government, the Scottish Assembly will have tax-raising powers, thus ensuring that the level of services provided can be determined in Scotland.
