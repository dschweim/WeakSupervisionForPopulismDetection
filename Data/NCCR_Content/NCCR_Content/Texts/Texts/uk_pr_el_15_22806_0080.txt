BREAKING: 2 million jobs created since 2010
Post date: 17/04/2015

It's just been announced that 2 million jobs have been created since 2010.

That's an amazing number, but it's not some dry, meaningless statistic - it's 2 million more people with the security of a pay packet; 2 million more families able to look forward to a brighter future.

It's no mystery why our economy is creating jobs: it's because of the hard work of the British people, and because of the measures David Cameron has put in place to back businesses and build a stronger, healthier economy.

Ed Miliband and the SNP would put all that at risk. Their plans for more borrowing, more debt and more taxes would mean chaos for Britain, and cost jobs.

We have to stop them. SHARE this to let friends know.
