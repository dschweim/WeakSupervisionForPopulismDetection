Press Release from Party: LibDem

More police needed to counter heightened crime fears says Huhne

Thu, 22 Apr 2010

"The Liberal Democrats are the only party committed to putting three thousand more police on the beat," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on todays British Crime Survey and police-recorded figures showing a 7% fall in crimes in 2009 compared to 2008, Chris Huhne said:

The fall in crime is encouraging but we must continue to be vigilant as we are still in troubled economic times.
 
Fear of crime is still far too high and only half of people think that the police are dealing with the crime and anti-social behaviour that matters to them.
 
Labour and the Tories are not going to restore public confidence by refusing to protect police numbers. The Liberal Democrats are the only party committed to putting three thousand more police on the beat.
