Press Release from Party: LibDem

Watch again: The second televised Leaders' debate

Fri, 23 Apr 2010

Last night saw Nick Clegg go head-to-head with the Labour and Conservative leaders in an international affairs debate on Sky.



Last night was the second of the three televised Leaders' debates. Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, debated with Gordon Brown and David Cameron about international and domestic affairs. Subjects discussed included Europe, immigration and climate change.

If you didn't see the debate last night, you can watch it online here.

The text of Nick's opening statement is below:

I am so proud of the values that have made our country great. Human rights. Democracy. The rule of law.

But the sad truth is that in recent years our Governments, under the two old parties, have let those values down.

We shouldnt have sent our troops into harms way without the right equipment and decent pay.

We shouldnt be facing allegations that we were complicit in torture.

We shouldnt have invaded Iraq.

I want us to lead in the world.

I want us to lead in Europe, not just complain from the sidelines.

I want us to lead in creating a world free of nuclear weapons.

And I want us to lead on the greatest challenge we all face, climate change.

My family knows what British values really mean.

My mother was freed by British troops from a prisoner of war camp.

If we do things differently we can once again be proud of the great role we can play as a force for good in the world.
