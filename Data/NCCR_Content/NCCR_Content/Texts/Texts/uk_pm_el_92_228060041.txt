Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

REFORMING OUR PRISONS

Prisons should be places which are austere but decent, providing a busy and positive regime which prepares prisoners for their ultimate release.

We have been reversing the Labour Party's neglect of the prison service in the 1970s. Since 1985, 14 new prisons have been opened 7 more will open over the next two years. The end of overcrowding is now in sight.

We have already taken steps to implement the key recommendations of the Woolf report on the future of our prisons. We will bring private sector skills in to enhance efficiency and increase value for money

We have put out to tender the contract for prison escort services, an approach which has worked well in other countries. The first contract for a privately managed remand centre has been awarded.

    We will sustain our massive prison reform and building programme.
    A reconstruction programme will end the degrading need for 'slopping out' by the end of 1994.
    We will reorganise prisoners' education, training and work opportunities.
    We will establish the Prison Service as a separate agency, whose director will have the clear responsibility for day-to day operations. The Home Secretary will remain ministerially accountable to Parliament for prison policy.
    We will increase the use of private sector management skills.
