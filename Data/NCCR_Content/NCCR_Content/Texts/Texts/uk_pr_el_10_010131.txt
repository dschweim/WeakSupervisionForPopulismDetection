Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour has let down everyone who wants a fairer Britain

Fri, 16 Apr 2010

The Liberal Democrats today launched their policies for a fairer Britain.

Britain has been let down by Labour who have taken many seats for granted for a generation and left Britain more unequal than ever.

The proposals will give every child a fair start in education and make sure the first 10,000 you earn is tax free, giving 3.6m people tax freedom and millions more a tax break of 700 a year.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg said:

In Hull, just like in cities across the North, Liberal Democrats are providing hope and opportunity to local people. We are the only challenger to Labour here.

Liberal Democrats have a vision for doing things differently that will make life fairer for millions of families who have been let down by Labour.

We will put money back in peoples pockets, making sure the first 10,000 you earn is tax free, paid for by closing loopholes that unfairly benefit those at the top.

We will break up the banks and rebuild the economy in Britains industrial heartlands.

We will put more money into our schools for smaller class sizes and more one-to-one tuition to provide every child with a fair start.

And we will clean up politics and make sure every vote counts, so people in the North can never again be taken for granted by Labour MPs who think they have a job for life.

As a Sheffield MP, I know just what a great place the North of England is. But Labour has let people down in the North for generations, and that has to change.
