Indecent that MPs should ask for legal aid says Huhne

Mon, 12 Apr 2010

If these MPs had any shred of decency they wouldnt have applied for legal aid in the first place," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on confirmation that three politicians accused of fiddling their expenses have won a bid to get the public to pick up their legal bill, Chris Huhne said:

Its absurd that well-to-do MPs on double national average earnings and extra expenses to boot should be entitled to legal aid when so many more deserving cases have been refused.

If these MPs had any shred of decency they wouldnt have applied for legal aid in the first place.
