    New figures show only eight per cent of disabled people on Work Programme get a job – Kate Green MP

    Kate Green MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Disabled People, said:

    “Today’s figures showing only eight per cent of people on sickness and disability benefits on the government’s Work Programme have found a job shows the Tory plan is failing.

    “The £2.8 billion Work Programme has failed to help hundreds of thousands of disabled people who want to fulfil their potential to work. It’s another example of Tory Welfare Waste.

    “A Labour government will replace the failing Work Programme with a new specialist Work Support programme to give sick and disabled people the tailored support they need to find a job. The Work Support programme is part of Labour’s better plan to raise living standards for working families.”
