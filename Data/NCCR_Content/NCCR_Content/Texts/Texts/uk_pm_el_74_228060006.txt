Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1974
-------------------------------------

People and rates

People pay tax not only to national government but to local government as well in the form of rates.

Local authority expenditure has been growing faster than the economy as a whole. Although on average 60 per cent of this expenditure is met by grant from the taxpayer, the burden on the domestic ratepayer has risen sharply. The rating system itself has come under increasing criticism because it does not reflect people's ability to pay.

Further heavy increases in rates are forecast. In these circumstances Conservatives will take the following steps.

TRANSFERRING EXPENDITURE

First, we shall transfer to central government in the medium term, the cost of teachers' salaries up to a specified number of teachers for each local education authority. Expenditure on police and the fire services will qualify for increased grants from the Exchequer. We shall see that this saving is passed on to the ratepayer.

FAIRER TAXES

Secondly, within the normal lifetime of a Parliament we shall abolish the domestic rating system and replace it by taxes more broadly based and related to people's ability to pay. Local authorities must continue to have some independent source of finance.
