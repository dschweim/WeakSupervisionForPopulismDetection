Sat, 24 Apr 2010

While Britain is not in the same situation as Greece, we must be aware that damage to growth or implausible plans to tackle the deficit may send us down the same road," the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor said.

Commenting on Greeces request for a bail-out from the EU and IMF, Vince Cable said:

Whats happened to Greece shows how quickly economic problems can snowball when there isnt a coherent plan to ensure both the health of the public finances and growth in the economy.

While Britain is not in the same situation as Greece, we must be aware that damage to growth or implausible plans to tackle the deficit may send us down the same road.

Only the Liberal Democrats have a clear plan to make the necessary savings to get the public finances back on track while ensuring businesses get the credit they need from banks to drive growth in the economy.
