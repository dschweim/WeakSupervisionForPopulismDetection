How would cutting child tax credits help society? - Cooper

Yvette CooperYvette Cooper, Labours Work and Pensions Secretary, responding to David Camerons speech this morning and the IFSs criticism of Tory policy on tax credits, said:

"David Cameron talks down Britain by claiming we are broken - but how would cutting child tax credits help society?

Today an independent analysis has said that his policy on tax credits is incomplete at best and misleading at worst.

"The Tories have been caught out trying to claim that their tax credit cuts wouldnt be painful, but the fact is that their plans would hit families up and down the country hard.
