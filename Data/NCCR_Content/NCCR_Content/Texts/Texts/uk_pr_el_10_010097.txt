Press Release from Party: LibDem

Tories utterly dishonest over right to sack corrupt MPs says Huhne

Wed, 07 Apr 2010

A vote for the old parties is a vote for corrupt and discredited politics," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on Tory plans to introduce a right to recall MPs found guilty of wrongdoing, Chris Huhne said:

The Tories are being utterly dishonest. How can you trust a party that promises something during an election that it blocked when it had the chance to make it happen?

Whether it's the right to sack crooked MPs, to take big money out of politics, or to clamp down on lobbyists, Labour and the Tories have stood in the way at every opportunity.

A vote for the old parties is a vote for corrupt and discredited politics.
