There was some uproar this week, as there always seems to be when I try and defend the interests of the British working man and woman.

Evidently Labour still sees things in black or white or brown. Theyre interested in putting people in little, convenient boxes so that they can label you, and target you as their spin doctors advise, as a special interest group.

Well Im not interested in any of that. If youre British, youre British, as far as Im concerned. And Britains government has a priority towards the people of this country first. Whether were talking about labour laws, our National Health Service, or otherwise  a governments first instinct should be towards the protection and wellbeing of its own people, especially the most vulnerable.
