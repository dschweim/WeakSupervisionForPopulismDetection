Party Manifesto: Labour (UK) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------


New Labour believes that Britain needs investment in schools and hospitals, not reckless tax cuts
Before 1997 we promised and kept to two tough years on spending to get the public finances in shape. Now, consistent with meeting our fiscal rules, we promise substantial rises for key public services. To help deliver our plans, our ten-year goal is the renewal of local government.
We will now:
- increase education spending by more than five per cent in real terms each year for the next three years as we increase the share of national income for education in the next Parliament.
- increase health spending by an average of six per cent in real terms each year for the next three years.
- increase spending on our police ? an extra F1.6 billion a year by 2003/04.
- increase spending on transport by 20 per cent for the next three years, on our way to a F180 billion investment of public and private money for transport over the next ten years.
- use a F400 million reward fund for local government in return for signing up to clear targets to improve local services.
New Labour believes in renewing a public service ethic by giving frontline staff new freedoms to respond to public needs.  For public services to be renewed, we will need more staff, properly rewarded. It is these frontline staff, operating in new ways, who will drive up standards in our key public services. We will decentralise power to make that possible.
We will now deliver:
- 20,000 more nurses who will be given new enhanced roles and more power for matrons and ward sisters with control over budgets.
- 10,000 more doctors, and access to a F500 million Performance Fund to spend on new patient services.
- 10,000 more teachers. Invest in further rapid promotion and rewards for classroom excellence, more classroom assistants and help with housing costs in high-cost areas.
- 6,000 extra police recruits, raising police numbers to their highest ever level, with strong local leadership and proper rewards for those on the frontline.
Investment and reform.
New Labour believes that a stable economy is the platform for rising living standards and opportunity for all
Our ten-year goals are for long-term economic stability and faster productivity growth than our main competitors.
We will now:
- deliver economic stability with mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances.
- reform further education, and help 750,000 adults achieve basic skills expand the Children?s Tax Credit to offer up to F1,000 per year for parents of newborn children.
- create a new Child Trust Fund for every child at birth.
- increase the minimum wage to F4.20.
- not raise the basic or top rate of income tax and extend the 10p band.
- strengthen regional economies with venture capital funds and new powers for reformed Regional Development Agencies.
- develop the Small Business Service and cut red tape.
- give British people the final say in any referendum on the single currency.
Public services: investment and reform Renewal of our public services is at the centre of new Labour?s manifesto.
A single aim drives our policy programme: to liberate people?s potential, by spreading power, wealth and opportunity more widely, breaking down the barriers that hold people back.
But this is only possible on the continued foundation of economic stability: mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances.
The manifesto is comprehensive. Here we set out some of the key measures for investment and reform that we believe give us a historic opportunity to modernise our schools, NHS, criminal justice system and welfare state.
New Labour believes that schools need a step change in reform to make quality education open to all
We plan a radical improvement in secondary schools, building on our success in primary schools. Our aim is to develop fully the talents of each child. Our ten-year goal is 50 per cent of young adults entering higher education.
We will now:
- ensure every secondary school develops a distinctive mission including the expansion of specialist schools.
- diversify state schools with new City Academies and more church schools.
- direct more money to headteachers, more freedom for successful schools.
- reform provision for 11- to 14-year-olds to ensure higher standards in English, maths, science and information technology.
- introduce new vocational options from 14 onwards, with expanded apprenticeship opportunities
- ensure primary schools offer more chance to learn languages, music and sport, as well as higher standards in the basics.
- provide a good-quality nursery place for every three-year-old.
New Labour believes that the NHS needs radical reform to fulfil its founding principle of quality treatment based on need, not ability to pay
The NHS needs radical reform if it is to be designed around the needs of patients. Investment is vital but not enough. Labour?s ten-year goal is a maximum waiting time of three months as we become a healthier nation with fast, high-quality treatment, free at the point of use.
We will now:
- decentralise power to give local Primary Care Trusts control of 75 per cent of NHS funding, and cut by two thirds the number of health authorities.
- reform the appointments system so that by the end of 2005 every hospital appointment is booked for the convenience of the patient.
- cut maximum waiting times by the end of 2005 for outpatient appointments from six months to three months and inpatients, from 18 to six months.
- work with the private sector to use spare capacity, where it makes sense, for NHS patients.
- create a new type of hospital ? specially built surgical units, managed by the NHS or the private sector ? to guarantee shorter waiting times allow successful NHS hospitals to take over failing ones.
New Labour believes that rights and responsibilities should be at the centre of reform of the welfare state? to lift children and pensioners out of poverty, and help parents balance work and family
We will continue to reform the tax and benefit system to reward work, not irresponsibility. Our ten-year goals are to achieve full employment in every region, to halve child poverty and tackle pensioner poverty.
We will now:
- create an integrated Child Credit of cash support for children, built on the foundation of universal child benefit.
- establish a new Pension Credit for lower- and middle-income pensioners.
- establish a new ?Employment First? interview for people entering the welfare system, and integrate the Benefits Agency and Employment Service through major reform.
- extend and increase paid maternity leave to F100 each week for six months.
- introduce paid paternity leave.
- expand childcare places to provide for 1.6 million children.
New Labour believes that crime can only be cut by dealing with the causes of crime as well as being tough on criminals
We plan the most comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system since the war ? to catch, convict, punish and rehabilitate more of the 100,000 persistent offenders. Our ten-year goal is a modernised criminal justice system with the burglary rate halved.
We will now:
- overhaul sentencing so that persistent offending results in more severe punishment.
- reform custodial sentences so that every offender gets punishment and rehabilitation designed to minimise reoffending.
- reform rules of evidence to simplify trials and bring the guilty to justice.
- introduce specialist, late-sitting and review courts to reflect crime patterns and properly monitor offenders.
- establish a new Criminal Assets Recovery Agency to seize assets of crime barons and a register of dealers to tackle drugs.
- introduce a victims bill of rights providing legal rights to compensation, support and information.
- Renewing public services: education reform Renewing public services: NHS reform.
- Renewing public services: criminal justice reform Renewing public services: welfare refo
Our ten-year goals: 
- Fiscal rules consistently met.
- Low inflation and interest rates as low as possible, as we deliver long-term economic stability. 
- Faster productivity growth than our main competitors, as we achieve rising living standards for all.
Our next steps:  
- Basic skills for 750,000 people.
- Venture capital funds in every region.
- F180 billion investment in transport, with 25 local rail and tram schemes.
- Raise the minimum wage to F4.20.
- F1,000 tax cut ? the Children?s Tax Credit ? for parents of newborn Children.
- Labour?s vision for all families: higher wages, affordable mortgages, fairer taxes and better public services.
