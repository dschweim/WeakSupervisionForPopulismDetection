Description of the content:
--------------
Ukip is preparing a manifesto pledge to slash billions of pounds from Scotlands budget to help to pay for tax cuts for English voters.

Text of the posting:
-------------
Are we Welsh going to get riled at this? If they get their way & slash the Welsh budget, the cuts will be deep. Some public services will no doubt have to be discontinued. If you know anyone in Wales thinking of voting for the right, please make sure they know about this pledge to cut the Welsh public services budget to fund tax cuts for people England. That's a vote against your national & your class interest. Does this make you angry?
To defeat this thinking, back Plaid Cymru.

"Under the controversial proposal, announced at the partys final conference before the election, subsidies currently paid from Westminster to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula would be abolished, saving up to £8bn a year."
