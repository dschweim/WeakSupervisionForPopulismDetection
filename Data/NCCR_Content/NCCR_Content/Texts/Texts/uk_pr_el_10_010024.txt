Press Release from Party: LibDem

UK and Scottish Government marine renewables funds have paid out nothing

Tue, 16 Mar 2010

Jim Murphy and Alex Salmond have today welcomed the leasing of sites for marine renewable energy generation off Scotland, despite the fact that their respective governments flagship schemes have paid out nothing to fund marine energy technologies.

Liberal Democrat research has found that:

    Not one project has yet received funding from the UK Governments 42m Marine Renewables Deployment Fund

    Not one project has yet received funding from the Scottish Governments Saltire Prize, although over 77,000 has been spent on advertising it 

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Shadow Scotland Secretary, Alistair Carmichael said:

Governments in London and Edinburgh have delivered little more than rhetoric on renewables so far.

Todays announcements are welcome, but this is the start of a process rather than the end.

Both Labour and the SNPs flagship marine energy funds have paid out nothing to technologies crying out for support.

The politicians falling over themselves to welcome these announcements must now make sure they deliver on their earlier commitments to ensure we see real progress.
