Camerons Big Society is patronising nonsense says Goldsworthy

Wed, 31 Mar 2010

The Big Society Day is just patronising nonsense, particularly for the thousands of dedicated people who are working to make their communities better every day.

Commenting on David Camerons Big Society proposals, Liberal Democrat Shadow Communities Secretary, Julia Goldsworthy said:
 
The Conservatives are so out of touch with real people in society that they believe our cities are like The Wire, half of all teenage girls are pregnant and that its reasonable to charge taxpayers for duck houses.
 
The Big Society Day is just patronising nonsense, particularly for the thousands of dedicated people who are working to make their communities better every day.
 
David Cameron will say anything to get a headline. Instead of gimmicks, the Liberal Democrats will give people real power over things that matter like their local police and health services.
