UKIP's Deputy Chairman Suzanne Evans tells Newsround other parties pick on them because of their views on immigration.

Text of the posting:
-------------
Suzanne Evans is right, #UKIP is unfairly targeted by the establishment and their corporate friends for our view that Britain needs a sensible and ethical immigration policy. 

It suits big business to have open door migration because it means an endless supply of cheap labour, pushing the wages of average workers down. But UKIP believes in more than just the profits of the multi-nationals. 

We believe in school places, housing, our NHS, and more. And what's clear is that they can't cope with 600,000 new migrants every year. At this election it's clear, UKIP is the only party that believes in Britain. #VoteUKIP on Thursday.
