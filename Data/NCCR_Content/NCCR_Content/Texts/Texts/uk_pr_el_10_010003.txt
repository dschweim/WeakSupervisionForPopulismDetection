Press Release from Party: LibDem

This will be the biggest fight of our political lives says Clegg

Fri, 12 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg will tonight deliver a rally speech to the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference.

Extracts from the speech are below:
 
This election is still wide open.
The people out there still havent made up their minds.
All bets are off.
 
This Government knows its come to the end of the road.
The Tories know people have started to see through them.
And voters know the Liberal Democrats offer something different.
Theyve seen us calling it right, taking a stand, putting principles back into politics
And they believe us when we say:
Dont waste this election.
Even if you feel hopeless after everything the other parties have put you through.
Dont give up on change.
And dont accept anything less than change that works for you.
 
But dont think its going to be easy.
Its going to be tough.
Tougher than anything weve ever done, because the closer we get the harder our opponents will fight to keep us down.
 
Theyll get nasty; theyll get personal
But when its really tough, thank your lucky stars youre not a Labour activist Desperately trying to keep a brave face on even though defeat is just round the corner.
 
Thank your lucky stars youre not a Tory activist
Certain for so long that victory would fall into your lap, only to discover now that the countrys not convinced.
 
But on Monday morning I want you to get out there and go for broke in what will be the biggest fight of our political lives.
