Great turnout in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, this evening. 

We will all remember that Nuneaton was the first key marginal to declare its results after the General Election. It indicated Labour's defeat.

I shared today's platform with candidates who narrowly missed re-election this year, including Chris Williamson, ex-MP for Derby North and Katy Clark, ex-MP for North Ayrshire and Arran.  Had there been a manifesto that posed a real economic alternative to austerity, they would both still be MPs. 

As I said yesterday, "Labour lost the election because they had no clear alternative to the Tories' unnecessary, self-serving austerity plans.

I've outlined policies which would provide decent jobs, homes, and schools, nurture high-skilled, socially productive industries and make Britain a fairer, more inclusive society.

In packed-out rallies from Aberdeen to Essex, these ideas have received an amazing welcome, showing that people are thirsting for a proper alternative to the current savage cuts.

I'm very much looking forward to going back to Nuneaton, where I'll welcome people's thoughts on how to keep building this amazing movement."
