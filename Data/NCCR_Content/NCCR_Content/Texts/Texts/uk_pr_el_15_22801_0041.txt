Responding to a report on HS2 by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

“One of the biggest infrastructure projects in a generation should not be jeopardised by short sightedness.
 
"Bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to the North West, HS2 will help to finally address the North – South divide.
 
"Those who doubt the project need to think hard about what we would lose if we didn’t go ahead with HS2 – 400,000 jobs and £50 billion of economic benefits.”
