Rules on overseas doctors inadequate says Lamb

Thu, 08 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrats will ensure that every foreign-trained doctor can prove they are able to communicate with patients and safe to work in the NHS," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting ahead of the Health Select Committee report today on the employment of foreign doctors in the NHS, Norman Lamb, said:

Patients lives have been put at risk because foreign doctors have been allowed to work in the NHS without any assessment of their language or medical skills.

Labour has known for some time that the current safeguards in place are not working but has completely failed to take action.

Liberal Democrats will ensure that every foreign-trained doctor can prove they are able to communicate with patients and safe to work in the NHS.
