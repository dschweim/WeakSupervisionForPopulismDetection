Early Years Education

Under both Labour and Conservative governments the inequalities in British society have been increased by the lack of proper early years education. Better-off children, with greater stimulus from the home, pre-school playgroups or from nursery schools, have had a flying start at primary school over those who have not had these advantages. Often children deprived in these early years never catch up. Too much early years provision is still not of a sufficient standard. We will guarantee quality nursery education, which makes a real contribution to intellectual, emotional and social development at this all-important stage in life. We will:

    Fund 1000 early years specialists to work with early years development partnerships to ensure that children receive proper stimulus in the early years either at nursery school, pre-school playgroups or at home.

    Establish a budget to give additional training to nursery teachers. This would fund courses and extra supply teachers to cover for those undertaking training.

    Increase funding for outdoor facilities for nurseries. Ultimately, all nurseries should have a place for children to play out of doors.

    Strengthen links between home and school recognising that children's early development depends critically on the relationship between school and family.

    Ensure that the early years curriculum has sufficient quality and breadth to facilitate intellectual, emotional and social development and ensure that play is recognised as a key component of this process.
