Press Release from Party: LibDem

Singh case underlines need for libel law reform says Evan Harris

Thu, 15 Apr 2010

For every Simon Singh who wins, there are hundreds of writers who never dare publish, or give up their legal battle because they cannot risk the cost of losing," says Dr Evan Harris, who leads the parliamentary campaign for libel law.

Commenting on news that the British Chiropractic Association has dropped its libel action against the science writer Simon Singh, Liberal Democrat Dr Evan Harris, who leads the parliamentary campaign for libel law reform and has been a vocal supporter of Dr Singh since the start of his defence, said:

Dr Singhs case underlines the need to radically change the law to save science writers and responsible journalists from having to spend two years of their life and 200,000 of their savings defending their right to debate matters of public interest, including childrens health.

For every Simon Singh who wins, there are hundreds of writers who never dare publish, or give up their legal battle because they cannot risk the cost of losing. That is why all the political parties must be held to their promises to take action.

The Liberal Democrats will bring in a robust public interest defence for responsible journalists and academics and require corporations to show damage and prove malice or recklessness.
