Press Release from Party: SNP

59 local & national champions for Scotland
Tue, 20/04/2010 - 17:39

Speaking as nominations for the Westminster general election formally closed this afternoon, the SNP's campaign coordinator Stewart Hosie said:

"This outstanding team of SNP candidates will champion the interests of their local communities and of Scotland at every opportunity.

"This general election is moving in Scotland's favour, and with the increasing probability of a balanced parliament, a vote for the SNP can tip the contest decisively in that direction.

"We will use the rest of this campaign to further expose the savage cuts agenda of Labour, the Tories and Liberals, and our candidates will offer a real alternative to the tired, discredited machine politics of Westminster and the London parties."
