Press Release from Party: SNP

Really listening to communities
Tue, 04/05/2010 - 15:07

Voters in Glasgow East are being given the opportunity to put their questions directly to Alex Salmond at a special community event, hosted by Elaine C Smith.

The final Ask Alex event of the campaign comes at the end of the SNP Leader's whistle stop tour of key seats across Scotland which today will see him campaign in Linlithgow, Falkirk and Glasgow East.

The event, which starts at 1900 at The Bridge on Westerhouse Road, will be a chance for voters to quiz the First Minster directly on the issues that matter to them.

Commenting on the event, Elaine C. Smith who will put the questions to the First Minister said:

This event is a fantastic opportunity for voters to ask anything and everything to the First Minister.

Im bringing him to my home constituency of Glasgow East so that people in my community can quiz him on the things that really matter.

In the TV debates the questions were screened and the audience were silenced  but at Ask Alex well be actively encouraging the audience to say whats on their mind.

At this event, and in this election campaign as a whole, the SNP has been shown to really listen to communities and react to their concerns - and this is exactly what theyll do at Westminster."
