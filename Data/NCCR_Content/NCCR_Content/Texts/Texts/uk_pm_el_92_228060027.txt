Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

OPEN GOVERNMENT

Government has traditionally been far too reluctant to provide information. This secrecy extends from the processes of Cabinet Government to schools which refuse to release exam results. Under the Citizen's Charter, a great deal more information is now being made available on the services provided by government.

We have also:

    replaced the catch-all provisions of the 1911 Official Secrets Act with narrower offences depending on specific tests of the harm likely to be caused by disclosure, while giving special protection to vital information relating to our national security;
    introduced rights to check certain personal records held on computer, and supported new rights of access to a range of government records;
    committed ourselves to a public right of access to information about the environment, including water supply, air quality dumping at sea and radioactive substances;
    made available more reports on matters of public concern such as food safety and industrial risks. 

We intend to carry forward this move towards greater openness.

    We will review the 80 or so statutory restrictions which exist on the disclosure of information - retaining only those needed to protect privacy and essential confidentiality.
    We will seek to provide greater access to personal records held by government.
    We will be less secretive about the workings of government. For example, when the Committees of the Cabinet are reconstituted after the election we will, for the first time, set out their names and membership. We will update and - for the first time - publish the guidance for Ministers on procedure.
