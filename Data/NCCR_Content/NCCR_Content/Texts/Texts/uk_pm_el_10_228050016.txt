Promoting diversityWe would:• Simplify PAYE by aligning the lowerNational Insurance limit with the personalallowance and abolishing the upper limit.• In the long run, aim to merge NationalInsurance into Income Tax.• Make it illegal for a contract with a self-employedperson to imply a pay rate belowthe national minimum wage.• Amend planning laws to allow appropriatesmall businesses to operate in residential areasand ensure all large new retail developmentsinclude spaces for small local businesses.• Help small businesses cope withregulation and provide tailored adviceon energy efficiency.• Introduce a network of local communitybanks, which will provide, among otherthings, a new source of finance for smallbusinesses.• Use our proposals to revitalise the PostOffice network (see page 19), in particularto help small businesses.• Provide special help for small ruralbusinesses.• Introduce legislation to penalise latepayment.• Reduce corporation tax for small firmsto 20% (see page 15 above).

Green councillor earns fairer rents deal for seafront tradersAfter Conservative-led Brighton & Hove City Council hiked rent and other costs for manyseafront businesses, members of the Seafront Business Association asked local GreenCouncillor Jason Kitcat for help. Through a Freedom of Information request Councillor Kitcatrevealed a council deal with private chartered surveyors, who would receive a commission of30 per cent on any rent increase they could negotiate with the seafront traders, on top oftheir fixed fee. As a result, the assessment of the majority of seafront rents has now beenhanded to a new in-house team; the result should be fairer rents for traders.
