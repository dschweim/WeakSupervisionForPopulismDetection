Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Sport

Sport plays an important role in our aim of raising the overall quality of life of all the country’s citizens. Participation in sport raises levels of fitness and health, and helps to foster local and national pride. We will:

    Promote Community Sports Plans. These will stimulate local authorities, schools and sports clubs to share facilities, which they lack due to school fields being sold off, and include provisions to support so-called minority sports.

    Develop sport in schools. Our simpler minimum curriculum entitlement replacing the national curriculum will allow greater provision of sport and physical education in schools.

Setting You Free

    Streamline government involvement in the arts by abolishing QUEST (Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team).

    Reduce interference by central government in culture and arts by decentralising decision-making powers and funding in England in order to promote community involvement in the arts. We will also protect the independence of trustees of museums and galleries.

    Remove the anomaly of Home Office regulation of film and video. We will pass this responsibility to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees all creative industries.
