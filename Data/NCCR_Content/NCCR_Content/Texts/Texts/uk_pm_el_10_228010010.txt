Party Manifesto: LibDem (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

your community. LiberalDemocrats believe in strongcommunities, where localpeople can come togetherto meet local needs, enjoy apleasant local environment,and feel free from the threatof crime.

rebuilding security, opportunity, homes and hopeLiberal Democrats believe in strong communities, where local people cancome together to meet local needs, enjoy a pleasant local environment, andfeel free from the threat of crime. We want every community to be safe andfair, and offer opportunities to people of every background.Under Labour and Conservative rule, communities have been let down.Governments have talked tough on crime but failed to take effective action.Lack of affordable housing has driven many young people out of thecommunities where they were born. Public transport is expensive when it isthere at all. Key local services like the Post Office have declined dramatically.Liberal Democrats will put thousands more police on the beat and makethem work more effectively to cut crime. We value Britain’s open, welcomingcharacter, and will protect it by changing the immigration system to make itfi rm and fair so that people can once again put their faith in it. We will investin public transport and cut rail fares, as well as providing more affordablehomes and protecting people from unfair repossessions. We will keep postoffices open, and will protect and restore the natural environment.cutting crime with more and better policeWe will focus on what works to cut crime. We will support more positiveactivities for young people to stop them getting involved in a life of crime.Labour and the Conservatives posture on penalties, which do not detercriminals. What does deter them is increasing the chances of being caught.That is why more police are needed on the streets – to provide a longer armfor the law. And we need to help the police to be more effective at catchingcriminals, spend less time on bureaucracy and more time preventing crime,reassuring the public and helping keep everyone safe.
Liberal Democrats will:• Pay for 3,000 more police on the beat, affordable because we arecutting other spending, such as scrapping pointless ID cards.• Reduce time-wasting bureaucracy at police stations with bettertechnology that can be deployed on the streets.• Give local people a real say over their police force through the directelection of police authorities. Authorities would still be able to co-optextra members to ensure diversity, experience and expertise.• Give far more power to elected police authorities, including the rightto sack and appoint the Chief Constable, set local policing priorities,and agree and determine budgets.• Strengthen the Youth Service by making it a statutory service, andencourage local authorities to provide youth services in partnershipwith young people and the voluntary sector.• Reform the police, with a full review of the very restrictive terms andconditions for police officer employment.• Turn the National Policing Improvement Agency into a National CrimeReduction Agency with a wider remit to test what policing techniquesand sentences work and spread best practice across police servicesand the criminal justice system.practical steps to make you saferWe will do all we can to prevent crime with practical measures that we knowwill make a difference and keep people safe.
We will:• Make hospitals share non-confidential information with the policeso they know where gun and knife crime is happening and can targetstop-and-search in gun and knife crime hot spots.• Bring in stop-on-request for night buses. You should be able toask the driver to let you off between stops, so you’re as close tohome as possible.• Require better recording of hate crimes against disabled, homosexualand transgender people, which are frequently not centrally recorded.• Ensure that financial resources, and police and court time, are notwasted on the unnecessary prosecution and imprisonment of drugusers and addicts; the focus instead should be on getting addicts
the treatment they need. Police should concentrate their efforts onorganised drug pushers and gangs.• Always base drugs policy on independent scientific advice, includingmaking the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs completelyindependent of government.making the justice system work to rehabilitatecriminals and reduce crimeLiberal Democrats believe that once a criminal has been caught, it is vital thatthe punishment they are given helps to turn them away from crime, and setthem back on the straight and narrow.Too many politicians have talked tough, meting out ever-longer prisonsentences, but doing far too little to tackle reoffending and to stop crimehappening in the first place. As a result, the government is spending moreand more on prisons, but those released from them are as likely as ever tocommit more crimes. We will:• Make prisoners work and contribute from their prison wages to acompensation fund for victims. As resources allow, we will increasethe number of hours prisoners spend in education and training.• Introduce a presumption against short-term sentences of less thansix months – replaced by rigorously enforced community sentenceswhich evidence shows are better at cutting reoffending.• Move offenders who are drug addicts or mentally ill into moreappropriate secure accommodation.• As a consequence of these changes, be able to cancel theGovernment’s billion-pound prison building programme.
• Give people a direct say in how petty criminals and those whoengage in anti-social behaviour are punished by setting upNeighbourhood Justice Panels (NJPs), like the one run by LiberalDemocrats in Somerset where 95 per cent of offenders have beenturned away from further crimes.• Champion restorative justice programmes, like NJPs, whichmake offenders confront their behaviour and are more successfulat reducing crime than traditional forms of punishment.firm but fair immigration systemBritain has always been an open, welcoming country, and thousands ofbusinesses, schools and hospitals in many parts of the country rely on peoplewho’ve come to live here from overseas. It would be wrong to try and endimmigration completely but we have to manage migration so that it benefitsBritain and is fair for everyone.The immigration system is in chaos after decades of incompetentmanagement. The Government has failed to plan properly for new migrants,making it harder for people to integrate. No-one has any idea how manypeople are here illegally, and there aren’t even exit checks at all ports andairports to ensure that people here on temporary visas go home on time.We will create a fair system that works and promotes integration. We will:• Immediately reintroduce exit checks at all ports and airports.• Secure Britain’s borders by giving a National Border Forcepolice powers.• Introduce a regional points-based system to ensure that migrantscan work only where they are needed. We need to enforce any
immigration system through rigorous checks on businesses anda crackdown on rogue employers who profit from illegal labour.• Prioritise deportation efforts on criminals, people-traffickers andother high-priority cases. We will let law-abiding families earncitizenship. We will allow people who have been in Britain withoutthe correct papers for ten years, but speak English, have a cleanrecord and want to live here long-term to earn their citizenship.This route to citizenship will not apply to people arriving after 2010.a safe haven for those fleeing persecutionBritain has a responsibility to welcome refugees fleeing wars and persecutionaround the world. Liberal Democrats will abide by Britain’s internationalobligations and restore confidence in the asylum system by making it fi rmand fair.We will:• Take responsibility for asylum away from the Home Office and give itto a wholly independent agency, as has been successful in Canada.• Push for a co-ordinated EU-wide asylum system to ensure that theresponsibility is fairly shared between member states.• Allow asylum seekers to work, saving taxpayers’ money and allowingthem the dignity of earning their living instead of having to depend onhandouts.• End the detention of children in immigration detention centres.
Alternative systems such as electronic tagging, stringent reportingrequirements and residence restrictions can be used for adults infamilies considered high flight risks.• End deportations of refugees to countries where they facepersecution, imprisonment, torture or execution and end the detentionof individuals for whom removal is not possible or imminent, exceptwhere there is a significant risk of absconding.better and more affordable homesIn a fair society, everyone should have the right to a decent home, but thisis not the reality of Britain today. There should be quality social and privaterented housing available for those who need or choose it. And it should beeasy to keep your home warm without harming the environment; Britishhouses are frequently poorly insulated, wasting money and contributing toglobal warming.Liberal Democrats will:• Make sure that repossession is always the last resort by changingthe powers of the courts.• Bring 250,000 empty homes back into use with cheap loans andgrants as part of our job creation plan.• Begin a national programme to insulate more homes paid for by thesavings from lower energy bills.• Make sure every new home is fully energy efficient by improvingbuilding regulations.
• Investigate reforming public sector borrowing requirements to freecouncils to borrow money against their assets in order to build a newgeneration of council homes, and allow them to keep all the revenuefrom these new homes. Over time, we will seek to provide a greaterdegree of subsidy as resources allow to increase the number of newsustainable homes being built.• Scrap burdensome Home Information Packs, retaining therequirement for homes to have an energy performance certificate.public transport you can rely onBritain needs a well-run, efficient transport system. Public transport is animportant part of a fair society and the best way to cut carbon emissionsfrom transport without trying to limit people’s opportunities to travel.We want to improve the experience for the traveller and cut carbonemissions. We will:• Switch traffic from road to rail by investing in local rail improvements,such as opening closed rail lines and adding extra tracks, paid for bycutting the major roads budget.• Cut rail fares, changing the contracts with Train Operating Companiesso that regulated fares fall behind inflation by 1 per cent each year,meaning a real-terms cut.• Make Network Rail refund a third of your ticket price if you have totake a rail replacement bus service.• Overhaul Network Rail to put the interests of passengers first andbring it under the Freedom of Information Act to make it more open.• Set up a UK Infrastructure Bank to invest in public transport likehigh speed rail.• Give councils greater powers to regulate bus services accordingto community needs so that local people get a real say over routesand fares.• Include the promotion of safer cycling and pedestrian routes in alllocal transport plans.restricting aviation growthThe emissions from rising aviation are a serious problem in the fight againstclimate change. But in some more remote parts of the country, flights area vital lifeline, and aviation is important for the economy as a whole. LiberalDemocrats believe that we should do all we can to ensure people usealternatives where that makes sense.
We will:• Replace the per-passenger Air Passenger Duty with a per-planeduty (PPD), so capturing freight movements by air for the first time.• Introduce an additional, higher rate of PPD on domestic flights forwhich alternative and less polluting travel is readily available.• Cancel plans for the third runway at Heathrow and any expansionof other airports in the South East.a fair deal for motoristsOur planned expansion of public transport will provide much-neededalternatives to private cars, and cut carbon emissions. However, in manyplaces there will always be a need for car travel, so we need to ensure thatit is as environmentally friendly as possible. We will:• Work through the EU for a zero emissions target for all new cars by2040 and extend targets to other vehicles.• Undertake preparations for the introduction of a system of roadpricing in a second parliament. Any such system would be revenue-neutralfor motorists, with revenue from cars used to abolish VehicleExcise Duty and reduce fuel duty, helping those in rural areas whohave no alternatives to road travel. Some of the revenue from lorrieswould be used to fund further extensions of high speed rail throughthe UK Infrastructure Bank.• Introduce a rural fuel discount scheme which would allow a reducedrate of fuel duty to be paid in remote rural areas, as is allowed underEU law.a green and pleasant landThe beauty of Britain’s natural landscape is vital to the quality of life ofthose who live there and to visitors. Liberal Democrats will change the waythe environment is protected so everyone has fair access to clean water,clean air, and open spaces. We’re the only party that takes seriously theresponsibility of protecting our natural inheritance and ensuring access for all.Liberal Democrats will:• Increase the general right of access to the countryside, along thelines of the model introduced by the Liberal Democrats in Scotland.• Abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission and return decision-making,including housing targets, to local people. We will createa third-party right of appeal in cases where planning decisions goagainst locally agreed plans.• Set targets for ‘zero waste’, aiming to end the use of landfill. Thatmeans less packaging, more recycling, and a huge increase inanaerobic digestion to generate energy from food and farm waste.We will also improve resource efficiency and reduce waste throughrequiring better design and durability product standards and reducingexcess packaging.• Introduce a new strategy to bring the UK back on target to halt theloss of habitats and species and as far as possible restore biodiversityby 2020.• Protect greenfield land and our built heritage by reducing the cost ofrepairs. We will equalise VAT on new build and repair on an overallrevenue-neutral basis. This will also help to reduce the costs of repairsto historic buildings.
• Make National Parks more democratically accountable, allowing aproportion of the Park boards to be elected.• Create a new designation – similar to Site of Special Scientific Intereststatus – to protect green areas of particular importance or value to thecommunity. We will aim to double the UK’s woodland cover by 2050.We will stop ‘garden grabbing’ by defining gardens as greenfield sitesin planning law so that they cannot so easily be built over.manage water for everyoneBritain has real problems in managing its scarce water resources. Somepeople face devastating floods, while others have drought conditions mostsummers. We will:• Stop major new housing developments in major flood risk areas.• Crack down on waste from the water companies and introducecompulsory smart meters in areas of shortage.• Introduce landscape-scale planning policies with a specific remit torestore water channels, rivers and wetlands and reduce flood risk byproperly utilising the natural capacity of the landscape to retain water.a fair deal for the countrysideLiberal Democrats are proud that we represent a large part of rural Britain.We believe a fair society is one where people can afford to work and live inthe countryside with accessible public services.Liberal Democrats will:• Give local authorities the power to set higher Council Tax rates forsecond homes and the option to require specific planning permissionfor new second homes, in areas where the number of such homes isthreatening the viability of a community.• Through our policy on Capital Gains Tax, ensure that those who usesecond homes as speculative investments will pay tax on enhancedcapital value at the same rate as on earned income, not at 18 percent as at present.• End the post office closure programme to keep post offices openin rural areas where they’re the lynchpin of community life, improveaccess to banking and help secure the future of the Post Officethrough a PostBank.• Promote schemes for affordable homes like equity mortgages and‘Home on the Farm’ which encourage farmers to convert existingbuildings into affordable housing.• Refund VAT to mountain rescue services.fair trade for British farmersIt is important to Britain’s future security that the country has a sustainablefarming industry. We will build on that strength and ensure that farmers getthe fair deal they deserve, are able to earn a living wage and also help toprotect our natural environment and heritage.Liberal Democrats will:• Create a legal Supermarket Code and a powerful independentregulator of Britain’s food market.
• Introduce a minimum level for the Single Farm Payment andconcentrate future reductions on the highest claims so that biglandowners get less, and the money goes to working farmers whoneed it, not people who farm one fi eld as a hobby.• Use the money freed by our reform to Single Farm Payments toprovide extra support for hill farmers, cheap loans to help farmersinvest in environmentally friendly biogas digesters and a new FarmingApprenticeship scheme.• Work within Europe for further reform of the Common AgriculturalPolicy, while continuing direct support for farmers, especially inupland and less favoured areas. We believe that a greater proportionof that support should be targeted at conservation, the environmentand tackling climate change, as well as at providing food securityfor a rapidly growing world population. Organic and reduced-inputfoodstuffs should be encouraged.• Help consumers to choose foods with the least environmentalimpact, through clearer labelling, and work with the EU to make surecountry-of-origin labels identify the source of the products, not wherethey are packaged. We will use government procurement policy toexpand the market for sustainable and fair-traded products.supporting the voluntary sectorAs Liberal Democrats, we are committed to handing power back to localcommunities. We believe that society is strengthened by communitiescoming together and engaging in voluntary activity, which sets people andneighbourhoods free to tackle local problems.Liberal Democrats will support the voluntary sector by:• Introducing ‘easy giving accounts’ at publicly-owned banks to allowpeople to operate charitable giving accounts alongside their currentaccounts.• Reforming Gift Aid to operate at a single rate of 23 per cent – givingmore money to charity while closing down a loophole for higher ratetax payers.• Reforming the process of criminal record checking so that volunteersneed only one record that is portable, rather than multiple checks foreach activity.
