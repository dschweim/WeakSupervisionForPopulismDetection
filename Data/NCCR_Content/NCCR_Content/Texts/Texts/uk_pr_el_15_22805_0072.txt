Natalie Bennett: Rise in Food Bank use evidence of inadequate welfare system

22 April 2015

Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said:

"Today's figures from the Trussell Trust are further evidence of an inadequate welfare system that forces a huge number of people within our society to live in poverty and leaves many without any income at all. These latest statistics also reflect the pernicious in-work poverty that affects 1 in 5 working people.

These figures show conclusively that our economy is failing those at the bottom whilst those at the top accumulate more and more wealth.

The Green Party would ensure that social security payments cover the basics, and allow people to live in dignity if they're unable to work or looking for a job. We would also raise the minimum wage to a £10 an hour Living Wage by 2020.

Labour's proposals to tackle rising food bank use simply don't go far enough. Yes, it's important to end exploitative zero-hours contracts and scrap the unjust bedroom tax. But Labour's plans to retain the household benefit cap and raise the minimum wage to only £8 an hour by October 2019 fail to take meaningful action to tackle the causes of poverty, and instead continue to demonise the poor.

We need to remember that 22% of those using food banks are in work. As long as people are not paid a decent wage they can live off, and our system of social security continues to unjustly sanction those it is designed to help, food bank use will continue to rise."
