Press Release from Party: SNP

SNP hopefuls to sign community commitment
Mon, 12/04/2010 - 13:37

Speaking after the SNP's campaign launch in Edinburgh today (Monday) the
party leader and First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond MSP, said SNP
candidates in the Westminster election will make a Community Commitment
to guarantee accessibility, accountability and openness to their
constituents.

SNP MPs already have a strong record of openness and accountability
with the partys MPs among the 10 hardest working MPs in the last
parliament. John Mason  who was only elected in 2008  has a work rate
that exceeds 24 MPs from the other parties who were elected in 2005.

Launching the campaign in Edinburgh today SNP leader and First
Minister Alex Salmond said:

The House of Commons is now held in
widespread disrepute. The best remedy is to offer a different style of
MP. Local champions whose mission is to articulate community concerns.

Every SNP candidate will sign a pledge of accessibility,
accountability and openness on issues like expenses  it will be their
Community Commitment.

It will be their guarantee, their
contract with the voters and it will set the standard for their work on
behalf of the people they represent. SNP MPs will not go to London to
settle in  they will be at Westminster to be their community's voice 
their community's champion.
