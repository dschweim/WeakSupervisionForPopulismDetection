Press Release from Party: LibDem

Stop and search powers overused and abused says Chris Huhne

Thu, 15 Apr 2010

When trainspotters, photographers and Japanese tourists are all up in arms, it should be clear even to Labour that this law needs to be tightened up," the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary said

Commenting on official figures showing a massive increase in the use of stop and search powers, Chris Huhne said:

Stop and search powers are being overused and abused.

When trainspotters, photographers and Japanese tourists are all up in arms, it should be clear even to Labour that this law needs to be tightened up.

Random and indiscriminate use of stop and search is an infringement of liberty and alienates the communities we rely on most for the intelligence and witnesses to fight terrorism.
