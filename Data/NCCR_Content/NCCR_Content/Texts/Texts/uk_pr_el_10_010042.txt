ory energy plans a recipe for disaster says Hughes

Fri, 19 Mar 2010

Todays announcement has shown us yet again that for all of Camerons posturing, the Tories cant be trusted to deliver on the environment," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary.

Commenting on the Conservatives Energy Security Green Paper, Simon Hughes said:

Blindly pledging to build a new nuclear plant every 18 months is a recipe for disaster.

Nuclear power has always required huge amounts of public money and David Camerons signal that the Tories are ready to turn on the taps of taxpayer support risks billions that we simply cant afford.

Nuclear energy is not clean energy. A new generation of nuclear power stations would leave us with a legacy of deadly radioactive waste that will take hundreds of years and billions of pounds to clean up.

As David Cameron himself said only four years ago, not having a plan to deal with this toxic legacy is completely irresponsible.

Todays announcement has shown us yet again that for all of Camerons posturing, the Tories cant be trusted to deliver on the environment.
