Sun, 18 Apr 2010

Train and ferry operators, and airlines when services resume, must behave responsibly and not use this as an opportunity to cash in on travelers desperate to get home," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary.

Commenting on the ongoing disruption to British travellers due to volcanic ash, Norman Baker said:

We urgently need to assess how much longer British passengers face being stranded for.

British Embassies in every country must act as a point of contact and information for those travelers who are stuck.

Ministers need to talk to train and ferry companies to find out whether extra services can be put on to bring people home.

Train and ferry operators, and airlines when services resume, must behave responsibly and not use this as an opportunity to cash in on travelers desperate to get home.
