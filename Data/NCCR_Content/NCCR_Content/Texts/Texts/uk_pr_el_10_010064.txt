Press Release from Party: LibDem

High court ruling puts final nail in Heathrow expansion plans says Kramer

Fri, 26 Mar 2010

The expansion of Heathrow would be a catastrophe for our climate and for the thousands of Londoners who would be forced to live with the huge disruption it will cause, said the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on runway three.

Commenting on the High Court ruling against Government plans to expand Heathrow, Susan Kramer MP who leads the Liberal Democrat campaign against the third runway, said:

This is a declaration of victory, the final nail in the coffin for the Government's attempts to steamroll over local and national opposition to its disastrous third runway plans.

The expansion of Heathrow would be a catastrophe for our climate and for the thousands of Londoners who would be forced to live with the huge disruption it will cause.

There is no way the Government can tear up what it has already done and start again - because we know the real climate change figures prove that there is no economic case for expansion at all.

Labour tough talk on climate change is just hot air.
