Party Manifesto: BNP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

Immigration:An Unparalleled Crisis Which Only the BNP Can Solve
• At current immigration and birth rates, indigenous British people are set to becomea minority well within 50 years. This will result in the extinction of the British people,culture, heritage and identity.• The BNP will take all steps necessary to halt and reverse this process. These stepswill include a halt to all further immigration, the deportation of all illegal immigrants,a halt to the “asylum” swindle and the promotion of the already existing voluntaryrepatriation scheme.• The BNP recognises the right of legally settled and law-abiding minorities to remain inthe UK and enjoy the full protection of the law, on the understanding that the indigenouspopulation of Britain has the right to remain the majority population of our nation.• The BNP will deport all foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain, regardless of theirimmigration status.• The BNP will review all citizenship grants awarded since Labour entered governmentin 1997, based on that party’s admission that they orchestrated mass immigration toforcibly change Britain’s demographics and to gerrymander elections.• The BNP will repeal the Race Relations Act and all other far leftist social engineeringprojects, such as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission aimed at enforcingmulticulturalism.• The BNP will regain sovereign control of our borders by increasing funding to theUK Border Agency.
