Thank you to everyone who helped me hold David Cameron to account for my first Prime Minister's Questions. On Wednesday, I will be be back at the despatch box. Do you have a question you want me to ask David Cameron? 

If you do, tell me here: labour.org.uk/your-PMQs

Here's a reminder of some of things we found out this week: 
- Because of David Cameron's tax credit cuts, most working people will be worse off until 2017

- In fact, 3.1 million working families will lose £1,000 per year

- David Cameron thinks a home that costs £450,000 is 'affordable'

- If you're a family on the new National 'Living' wage, you could only afford one of his starter homes in Hull, Barrow-in-Furness or Southport
