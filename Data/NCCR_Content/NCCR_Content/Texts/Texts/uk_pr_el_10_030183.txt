Press Release from Party: SNP


Championing Glasgow's East End
Tue, 04/05/2010 - 13:44

John Mason, SNP candidate for Glasgow East, has warmly welcomed today's announcement by the Scottish Goverment of an investment of 2.8 million to support a major redevelopment of Dalmarnock station in Glasgow's East End.

Finance Secretary John Swinney announced the allocation of European funding, which will transform Dalmarnock station into a key transport hub in time for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014.

Welcoming the news, Mr Mason said:

"The redevelopment of Dalmarnock station is exactly the kind of investment that the East of Glasgow needs. As well as providing a crucial transport hub for the visitors to the Commonwealth Games, this development will bring lasting benefits for the people of the East End, greatly improving transport links to this part of the city and supporting the wider regeneration of the whole area in the long term.

"By providing ease of access to a wider range of transport choices, the new Dalmarnock station will encourage more people to come and make their homes in the East End and help to secure the lasting Commonwealth Games legacy that the SNP government has made a priority from the very day that Glasgow won the Games.

"John Swinney's announcement today shows once again that this SNP government is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to supporting jobs and communities in Glasgow."
