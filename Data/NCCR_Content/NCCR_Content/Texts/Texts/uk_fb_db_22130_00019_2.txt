Diwrnod arbennig yng Ng?yl y Gelli ddoe - roedd fy sesiwn yn wych.
Really enjoyed speaking at the Hay Festival - "What do we want?: A new kind of politics" with Rosie Boycott, Peter Henessey & Dr. Ruth Scurr, chaired by Nik Gowing. Coalitions, is two-party politics over, PR, devolution, participation, young people & has the House of Commons had its day, were some of the questions covered.  Although the discussion was London / Westminster focussed, we managed to cover politics from other places, including, of course, Wales. Some good questions from the packed audience. Diolch am eich diddordeb.
