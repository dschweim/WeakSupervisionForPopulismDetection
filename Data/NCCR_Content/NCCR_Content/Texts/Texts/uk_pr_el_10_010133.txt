Press Release from Party: LibDem

Ridiculous not to consider Trident in the defence review says Nick Harvey

Sat, 17 Apr 2010

At a time when the threats to our country have changed dramatically, Labour wants to press ahead with a 100bn nuclear weapons system designed for the Cold War. That makes no sense, the Liberal Democrat Shadow Defence Secretary said.

Responding to Bob Ainsworths comments on The Today Programme regarding Liberal Democrat policy on Trident, Nick Harvey said:

This is pretty desperate stuff from Labour. Key figures in the military and defence establishment have called for a rethink on Trident.

The Labour and Conservative policy of like-for-like replacement of Trident is absurd.

At a time when the threats to our country have changed dramatically, when President Obama has just warned of the greatest nuclear danger being from terrorist use of nuclear material and when our troops are short on vital equipment in Afghanistan, Labour wants to press ahead with a 100bn nuclear weapons system designed for the Cold War and wont even consider Trident in the upcoming defence review. That makes no sense.
