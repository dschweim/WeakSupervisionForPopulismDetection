Press Release from Party: SNP

Trident set to be central to General Election
Sat, 13/03/2010 - 13:16
SNP Leader Alex Salmond led a march against Trident through Edinburgh and told the crowd that only a vote for the SNP was a vote against Trident.
 
Scottish National Party leader and First Minister Alex Salmond MSP joined Reverend Ian Galloway, CND Chair Kate Hudson, MPs and MSPs,  actor David Hayman, and hundreds of ordinary Scots in a march through Edinburgh protesting against the replacement of Trident on Saturday 12th March 2010. 
Addressing the crowd, Mr Salmond said that Trident would be a central issue in the General Election campaign, and that the decision to waste 100,000 million on new nuclear missiles while public services are under threat was "indefensible and obscene".
Mr Salmond said:
"There is massive opposition to dumping a new generation of weapons of mass destruction in Scotland.  The Scottish Parliament has voted against the 'son of Trident', a majority of Scottish MPs reject it, and it is going to be a central issue in the General Election campaign.
"At a time when Westminster is imposing cuts in public services to deal with Labour's recession, with much deeper cuts planned in the future, and the Scottish Government's budget is falling in real terms for the first time since devolution, to waste 100 billion on weapons of mass destruction is indefensible and obscene.
"Any way you look at it - on moral, financial, or defence grounds - renewal of Trident is completely untenable, and I believe that position can prevail in the General Election.
"The tide has well and truly turned on Trident - and the General Election offers the opportunity to ensure that weapons of mass destruction are banished from Scotland forever."
