Truancy reaches record levels
Thursday, March 25 2010

Shadow Schools Minister Nick Gibb has reacted to new government figures showing that truancy has reached record levels.

"Despite over 1 billion of spending the Government has failed to tackle truancy", he said.

"Unauthorised absences are at an all time high and 67,000 children miss school every day".

Truancy has risen by 44 per cent since 1997. In addition:

    One in ten children miss at least four weeks of school a year.
    Pupils on free school meals are 3 times as likely to be persistent truants.
    Truancy is six times higher in poor areas than in rich areas.

"Persistent absenteeism and truancy is linked with low levels of literacy and must be tackled", Gibb said. "We need to address underlying causes of truancy  the fact that so many children still struggle with reading and poor discipline in schools fuels bullying".

He added that the Conservatives are "committed to improving behaviour in our schools by giving teachers the powers they need to deal with disruptive pupils".

"We will also allow schools to insist on enforceable home school contracts  so parents play their part in ensuring their children go to school."
