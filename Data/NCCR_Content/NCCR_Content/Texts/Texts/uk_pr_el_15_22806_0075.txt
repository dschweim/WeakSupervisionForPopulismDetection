Post date: 16/04/2015

This election is about the type of country we want to be.

We can keep going forward with the Conservatives, and build a country where those who work hard and do the right thing can enjoy a good life.

Or we can go back to square one with Labour, who would put our economy and our future at risk with their plans for more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.
