2 million more people now in work
Post date: 17/04/2015

There are now over 2 million more people in work than in 2010 – that’s more families with the stability and security of a regular pay packet.

This is thanks to the hard work and the determination of the British people, and the Conservatives' strong leadership and clear economic plan.

It would all be put at risk with the chaos of a Miliband-SNP stitch-up, hiking borrowing, hurting the economy, and costing jobs – and it’ll be hardworking taxpayers who’ll pay.
