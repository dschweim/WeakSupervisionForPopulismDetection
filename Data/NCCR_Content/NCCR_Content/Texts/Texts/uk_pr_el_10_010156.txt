Press Release from Party: LibDem

Nick Clegg launches Liberal Democrat environment manifesto

Sun, 25 Apr 2010

The Liberal Democrats have set out radical plans to protect the environment and set the economy on a path to a zero carbon Britain.




The proposals include a 3.1bn green economic stimulus package, plans to slash energy use and improve energy efficiency, and a UK Infrastructure Bank to embed green investment for the long term.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg said:

This election is not like any other.

Climate scientists tell us that the next government will be the last that can stop dangerous climate change.

That is a huge responsibility for the party that wins this election. But its an even bigger responsibility for the voters that will choose them on May 6.

So my message is this: dont settle for a Labour party that has had thirteen years to deliver on the environment and has failed. Dont settle for a Conservative party that talks the talk on green issues, only to align themselves with climate change deniers in the European Parliament. And dont give your vote to a Green Party that cannot make a difference in Westminster.

Instead, choose the only party that was taking a stand on saving the planet well before it became fashionable. The only party that has led the way on tackling climate change, from championing the 10:10 campaign in our councils, to setting out radical plans in Parliament to cut Britains carbon emissions. Choose the only party that in the wake of the economic crisis is setting out a credible vision for a new and sustainable economy.

Something really exciting is happening in British politics. This is a huge opportunity to set Britain on the road to a prosperous and green future.

We should seize it.
