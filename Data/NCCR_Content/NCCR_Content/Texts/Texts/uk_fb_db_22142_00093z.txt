Text of the posting:
-------------
Yesterday I wrote to David Cameron about the Saudi protester, Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who was arrested as a child in 2012 and sentenced to death.  

As I explained to the Prime Minister, Ali has now exhausted all his appeals and could be executed any day – in a particularly horrific manner, which involves beheading and the public display or ‘crucifixion’ of the body.

You can read my full letter below. Among other points, I asked Cameron, "Will you step in to terminate the Ministry of Justice's bid to provide services to the Saudi prisons system - the very body, I should stress, which will be responsible for carrying out Ali's execution?" 

I urged Cameron to act to prevent this grave injustice because there is no time to spare.
