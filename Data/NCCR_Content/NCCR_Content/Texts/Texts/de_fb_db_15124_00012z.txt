I'm very proud that the European Parliament decided today to award the 2015 #SakharovPrize to the blogger and writer Raif Badawi. For expressing his views and defending human rights, he was condemned to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. I called today Saudi Arabia authorities to release him immediately. Freedom of speech is and will remain not negotiable.
