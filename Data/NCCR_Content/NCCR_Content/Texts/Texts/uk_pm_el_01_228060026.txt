Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

A stronger society

Common sense means responsible citizens and a smaller state

    Create an Office of Civil Society to champion families, voluntary organisations and faith communities
    Reform taxation for charities
    Pay independent groups to get people back to work and find them lasting jobs
    Protect the savings of disabled people and help them find work
    Tackle welfare fraud

A strong society rests on responsible individuals and families. They need to be able to turn to straightforward, reliable
help when times are bad. But that should not become dependence on the state when times are good.

Labour promised to reform the welfare state, but they shirked the challenge.

It's time for common sense.

The next Conservative Government will help build a stronger society. We will provide support for individuals and families when they need it. And we will encourage people to take responsibility for themselves and their families.

Tolerance is one of Britain's historic virtues. A strong society is built on respect for all people - whatever their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
