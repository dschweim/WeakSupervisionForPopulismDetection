Press Release from Party: LibDem

Israeli air attacks may escalate cycle of violence says Ed Davey

Fri, 02 Apr 2010

"The international community must step up the pressure to stop the rocket attacks on Israel whilst pushing for restraint", the Liberal Democrat Shadow Foreign Secretary said.

Commenting on recent reports of Israeli air attacks on the Hamas ruled Gaza Strip, Ed Davey said:

Unless there is rapid progress towards restarting the peace talks, the fear must be that this will be the prelude to an escalating cycle of violence.

The international community must step up the pressure to stop the rocket attacks on Israel whilst pushing for restraint.

We have to avoid a return to the appalling killings witnessed just 15 months ago. Israel should realise that ending the blockade on Gaza is more in its own long-term security interests than the current traumatic stranglehold."
