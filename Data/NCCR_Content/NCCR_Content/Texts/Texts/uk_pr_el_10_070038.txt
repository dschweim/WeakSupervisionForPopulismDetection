Press Release from Party: UKIP

Lib Dems Spitfire leaflet furore

Thursday, 22nd April 2010

Lib Dem hypocrites who boast about weakening Britain's defence capabilities are now claiming they are party which has held always held a strong defence policy.

"While Nick Clegg claims we shouldn't feel proud about beating the Nazis in World War II, a Lib Dem candidate in Dover John Brigden has plastered a Spitfire across his election leaflets", said Nigel Farage MEP today.

The UKIP spokesman said, "The rank hypocrisy of Clegg's Liberal Democrats is just mindblowing. This is a party that would hand over our country trussed and bound to the EU. That believes that the pound should be abolished in favour of the failed Euro, that wants us to be part of a European army, that is happy to hand British citizens over to foreign courts, with no evidence against them, through the European arrest Warrant."

He went on "The leaflet states that 'The Liberal Democrats have always been strong on Defence' which would be laughable if it wasn't so dishonest. Then they boast about destroying our defence capacity by abolishing Trident - a policy that would strip us of any clout at a global level and could jeopardise our position on the UN Security Council and in NATO - something that their allies in the European Union have been trying to do for years".

"Nick Clegg has to come clean", said Farage, "Does he believe in our country's independence and ability to operate as a sovereign nation or doesn't he? This flyer merely shows his parties inconsistencies and double standards".
