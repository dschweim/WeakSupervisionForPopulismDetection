Press Release from Party: LibDem

Inflation blip shows how vulnerable economy is says Cable

Tue, 20 Apr 2010

The rise in gas prices has had a huge impact on household bills and is hitting some of our most vulnerable people the hardest," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the rise in inflation reported today, Vince Cable said:

The inflation rise appears to be a blip caused by things that are out of our control, like gas and oil prices. This shows just how fragile our economy is and how vulnerable it is to outside forces.
 
The rise in gas prices has had a huge impact on household bills and is hitting some of our most vulnerable people the hardest.
 
The Liberal Democrats will make energy companies cut the number of tariffs, simplify bills and charge people less for the first units of energy they use, so that those who use less pay less. We will also introduce smart meters into all households within five years.
