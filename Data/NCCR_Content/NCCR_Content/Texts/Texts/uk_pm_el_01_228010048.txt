-------------------------------------

Green Action

Strengthening National Environment Policy

Strengthen government environment policy by transferring the Department of Trade and Industry’s water and energy roles to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, renamed the Department of the Environment, Energy and Transport. Meanwhile, housing, regional issues and local government will move from the DETR to a new Department of Local Government and the Regions.

Improving Environmental Accountability

An Environmental Responsibility Act will set out reporting requirements and environmental standards for government and businesses, and introduce environmental audits across all government departments and local authorities where this is not already done.
