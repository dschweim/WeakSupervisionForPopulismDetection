I attended a meeting organised by my colleague the Shadow Environment Minister, Barry Gardiner MP this September to address the issue of poor air quality in the UK. Poor air quality in Britains towns and cities remain an important issue and causes 29,000 premature deaths each year. The Government has breached the European Air Quality Directive and yet they plan to reduce air quality monitoring in England.
