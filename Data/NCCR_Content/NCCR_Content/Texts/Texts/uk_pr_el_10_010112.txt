Every Labour manifesto is full of broken promises says Alexander

Mon, 12 Apr 2010

The tax system is less fair than when Labour came to power," said Nick Cleggs Chief of Staff.



Commenting on Labours manifesto launch, Danny Alexander said:
 
Every Labour manifesto since 1997 has been full of promises they have broken. They simply cant be trusted to do a single thing they say.

The tax system is less fair than when Labour came to power.

The only party that is committed to making Britain fairer is the Liberal Democrats.
