Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Law and Order

Cutting crime – more resources, justice for all

We all want freedom from crime. Fear of crime blights the lives of many people, particularly the most vulnerable in society. The state should offer all its citizens equal and adequate protection. Our approach is rooted in the belief that the best way to beat crime in the medium and long term is to have effective policies to tackle its causes.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Recruit 6000 extra police officers

    Fund 2000 part-time community officers

    Reinforce front-line police with a new Community Safety Constabulary and by retaining retired officers in a back-up role

    Cut reoffending by preparing prisoners adequately for a law-abiding life on their release

    Give victims greater rights to be heard in court

During their eighteen years in office, the Conservatives pursued a policy on crime which was superficially populist yet highly ineffective. They filled the prisons to overflowing, at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Crime doubled, violent rose crime year after year, and the number of convictions fell. Meanwhile, contrary to repeated promises, police numbers fell during the last Conservative government.

Labour has been trying to sound as tough or tougher than the Conservatives, but it is no more effective. Police numbers have fallen further over the past four years. Labour too often proposes simplistic solutions. Many are impractical or irrelevant. Some actually undermine civil liberties.
