Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Civil Liberties

Setting all people free

Civil liberties are the basis of a genuinely free society. They are essential to a liberal society in which people are enabled to fulfil their potential and make informed choices about their lives.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Pass an Equality Act to outlaw all forms of discrimination

    Reform the asylum system so that applicants are dealt with fairly and quickly

    Extend Freedom of Information legislation to provide genuinely open administration at all levels of government

Civil liberties are at the core of our critique of the other parties. Asylum seekers, in particular, have been treated in a disgraceful manner by both Labour and the Conservatives. The BSE scandal demonstrated the dangers of resistance to freedom of information legislation. Labour has made a start but has fallen short of building the truly open society we want to see.

We will establish a strong framework of individual rights, extending the protection already afforded by European law, so that the rights of the individual outweigh the interests of the government.
