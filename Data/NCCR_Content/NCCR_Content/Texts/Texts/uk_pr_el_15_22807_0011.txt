Immigration is holding back wages of working class Britain

"The chancellor was, after all, supposed to have eliminated the deficit by now, not be bequeathing his successor – or indeed himself – a £90billion problem going into the next parliament and a national debt approaching £1.5trillion.

"His much heralded long-term economic plan was left looking more like a long grass economic plan. And nowhere in his speech did he even begin to address the central issue restraining living standards for millions of British working people; the mass, uncontrolled immigration into semi-skilled and unskilled job vacancies that has characterised the British economy for the last decade and more."
