Unsurprising holes in the Liberal Democrat Manifesto
Wednesday, April 14 2010
Philip Hammond

Philip Hammond, the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has commented on the financial black holes and policy U-turns in the Liberal Democrats' manifesto.

"There are lots of things in this manifesto that look appealing", he said. "The problem is that the sums just dont add up".  

The Liberal Democrats claim they have been honest by setting out net savings of 10.7 billion a year by the end of the Parliament to help close the deficit. But in fact there is an 11.6 billion black hole in Vince Cables numbers, so their plans would actually increase borrowing by 900 million, not reduce it.

Vince Cable has also performed a U-turn on Labour's jobs tax, saying he would reverse it after all. The Liberal Democrats can't have it both ways.

Hammond added that this general election is only going to produce two results: "five more years of Gordon Browns tired government making things worse, or a Conservative government led by David Cameron".

"So if you want a greener, more family-friendly, liberal future for Britain then you need to vote Conservative on 6th May".
