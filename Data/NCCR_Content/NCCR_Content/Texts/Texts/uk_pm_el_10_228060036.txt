Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------


Conserve and enhance the natural environment
We will protect and improve the UKÕs natural environment, and pioneer new schemes to improveconservation. We will push for reform of the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies topromote sustainable farming and fishing. We will promote high animal welfare standards andensure that government procures locally-produced food wherever possible. We will work towardsa zero-waste society.Conservatives understand the inherent valueof conserving things, and we know theimportance of ensuring that we provide agood quality of life for future generations. Ournatural environment has been degraded andurgent action is needed to address the loss ofvital ecosystems in the face of climate changeand development. Labour have relied too muchon regulation and top-down targets that havefailed to halt biodiversity loss.We need to act now to enhance biodiversity,protect our countryside and marineenvironment, and secure the vital eco-systemsthat sustain life on land, in our rivers and inour seas. A Conservative government will takea broad approach to improving the naturalenvironment as a whole, so that we can ensurea secure future for the natural world where vitalecological assets are protected and resourcesare used more responsibly.Conserve wildlifeToo many animals remain at risk of extinction,and climate change will put even more pressureon endangered species and precious habitats.
