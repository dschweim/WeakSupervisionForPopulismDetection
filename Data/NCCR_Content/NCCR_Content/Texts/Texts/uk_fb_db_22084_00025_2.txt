Text of the posting:
-------------
What a day we had yesterday  nine constituencies in one day ending with a packed public meeting in Dumfries.
 
When I look back over the last couple of months it is amazing to think of the amount of work which has gone into contacting voters.
 
Thank you so much for everything you have done.
 
But if you were to ask me to sum up the campaign in one word it would be  selfie!

By now I must have had selfies taken with thousands of people. Are you one of them? Why not post it up on Facebook and Twitter today using the hashtag #ImWithNicola
 
If we havent had the chance to get a selfie together dont worry, you dont have to miss out. Why not post a picture of yourself with an Im with Nicola sign. You can download a copy here: https://goo.gl/1oDvPG
