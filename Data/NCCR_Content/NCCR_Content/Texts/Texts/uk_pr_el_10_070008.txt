Batten slams astonishing benefits ruling

Wednesday, 24th March 2010

Immigration expert and UKIP MEP Gerard Batten has slammed an outrageous court ruling that allows an unemployed immigrant to claim British child benefit payments despite his offspring living in Portugal.

In a disturbing example of EU law trumping UK law, three judges at the High Court in London yesterday opened the door to thousands more benefits tourists.

The judges confirmed that European Commission regulations overrule UK law, which states clearly: No child benefit shall be payable in respect of a child for a week unless he is in Great Britain in that week.

Mr Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said: We were already paying child benefit for children living abroad, and now EU citizens themselves on benefits in the UK can claim child benefit for children they left at home.

"We already provide an international health service that treats people from all over the world, and now we will provide an international benefits service.

"Many EU citizens will naturally gravitate to those countries with the most generous benefits systems  especially Britain. How can a country that is 1.5 trillion in debt pay benefits to the children of non-citizens who live abroad? 

"Its completely bonkers."

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, also spoke out against the extraordinary landmark ruling.

"This opens the door to a huge bill for taxpayers which is utterly unjustified," he said. "Now there are even greater incentives for people to come to Britain trying to take advantage of the benefits system.

"Time and again it seems these judgements go against the best interests of hard-pressed British taxpayers.
