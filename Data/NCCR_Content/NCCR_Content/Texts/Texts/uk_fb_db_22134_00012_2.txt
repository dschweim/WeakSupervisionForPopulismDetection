-------------
Yesterday I visited Grange Primary School in Southwark, to join in a PE class with 7 and 8 year olds and talk to them about sports and self-confidence. As Minister for Women, today Im publishing research into body image and sports participation amongst young girls  which worryingly shows that after this age, low confidence and body consciousness can combine to reduce girls eagerness to take part and have lasting effects on their health right into adulthood. This can be part of a vicious circle; if women dont take part, their daughters wont either.

That is why I absolutely love the This Girl Can  campaign which aims to get women participating in sport. In government, Ive also worked with the The PSHE Association, who have created materials to help teachers deal with body confidence issues in class. I believe we need to keep all girls enjoying exercise, and both schools and families can play their part - do share your views below.
