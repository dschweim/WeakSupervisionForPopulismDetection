Governments rural incompetence cost taxpayers 90m says Farron

Wed, 17 Mar 2010

It is time for a simpler, more cost-effective system which helps farmers get their payments efficiently, effectively and on time," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Rural Affairs Secretary.

Commenting on the UKs 15.9m fine for failing to comply with Common Agricultural Policy rules, Tim Farron said:

The British taxpayer is now stumping up for the Governments incompetence but British farmers have already paid a high price.

The Governments failure to issue payments promptly in 2005 pushed many farmers to the brink.

The chaotic handling of the Rural Payments Agency has now cost the British taxpayer 90m in fines to the EU.
 
Its absolutely staggering that Defra is throwing money down the drain at a time when all Government departments are being asked to tighten their belts.
 
It is time for a simpler, more cost-effective system which helps farmers get their payments efficiently, effectively and on time.
