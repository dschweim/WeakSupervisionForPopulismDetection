Mae Plaid Cymru yn gwrthod bod angen gwneud mwy o doriadau.  
We need to support our communities by investing in our public services, instead of cutting their budgets like the Westminster parties want to do. Plaid Cymru will never support an austerity budget because we don't think that the people should pay for the mistakes of the wealthy elite.
