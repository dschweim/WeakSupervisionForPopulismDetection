Party Manifesto: Green (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

• Invest in the green economy now –and if, in certain vital sectors such as energygeneration, the private sector is acting tooslowly and on an insufficient scale, then theGovernment must take the lead.
• Our programme has to be paid for, and weaccept that the Government borrowing of12% of GDP is unsustainable. Like theGovernment, we would aim to more thanhalve the deficit by 2013, and the programmeof taxation and spending in this manifesto isdesigned to achieve that.• Raise taxation from its current very lowlevel of only 36% of GDP – for example itexceeded 40% in all Mrs Thatcher’s years inoffice. The fiscal gap is not caused by toomuch public spending but by taxationdropping to unacceptably low levels.• Ensure that those most able to paybear their fair share, and introduce amuch-needed increase in environmentaltaxation.• Regulate the financial sector more strictly,preferably at the international or EU level,but if necessary just in the UK. In particular,separate retail from investment banking.• Support new institutions like a greeninvestment bank and local community banksin the financial sector, and new ways ofinvesting in the green economy, such as greennational savings bonds.• Reverse the trend towards an economyever more dependent on financial services,and build a new and sustainable agriculturaland manufacturing base to the economy.• Protect basic public services, which arethe foundation of an equitable society.Modest efficiency savings may be possible(perhaps £2–3bn, or 0.25% over the entirepublic service each year, and in particular byimproving energy efficiency in schools andhospitals), but nothing on the scale reliedupon by the other parties to make their figuresadd up. Cuts to health and education serviceswill hit the poorest and most vulnerable first.We must help the poorest pensioners andchildren in particular.• Abandon gross domestic product as the keymeasure of economic success, and seekinstead to increase our overall welfare.• Encourage greater sharing of intellectualproperty by reducing, but not abandoning,levels of patent and copyright protection.In particular we would legalise peer to peercopying where it is not done as a businessand make it impossible to patent broadsoftware and cultural ideas.
