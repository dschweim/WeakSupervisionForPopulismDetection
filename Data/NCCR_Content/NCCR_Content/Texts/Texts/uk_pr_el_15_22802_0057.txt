    It’s right that Afzal Amin has gone but what on earth took so long?

    Jon Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, commenting on the resignation of Afzal Amin said:

    “It’s right that Afzal Amin has gone but what on earth took so long? Given the serious allegations involved it was obvious that David Cameron should have expelled him immediately, instead he dithered until the candidate himself jumped before he was pushed.

    "This deeply damaging episode has exposed a Conservative campaign in chaos and a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision.”
