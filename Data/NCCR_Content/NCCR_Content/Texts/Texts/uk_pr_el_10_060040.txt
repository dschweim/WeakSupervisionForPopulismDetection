Unemployment up almost two thirds in rural areas
Thursday, April 8 2010

Official figures obtained by the Conservatives show that rural unemployment in England and Wales has soared by around 64 per cent in the last two years. 

Over the same period, unemployment rose by 52 per cent for England and Wales as a whole, showing that rural areas have been hit disproportionately hard.  

"Gordon Browns recession has hit rural areas hard and the loss of jobs in our villages and market towns is having a devastating effect", said Nick Herbert, the Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

At the end of 2009, there were an estimated 299,000 people unemployed in rural areas, compared to 228,000 at the end of 2008 and 182,000 at the end of 2007. 

"Labour has ignored the countryside and their jobs tax will kill the recovery and particularly hit the small and medium-sized businesses on which the rural economy depends, so the Conservatives will cut waste to stop the National Insurance rise", Herbert added.

"Seven out of ten working people will be better off under the Conservatives, and nobody will be worse off.  Rural communities cant afford five more years of Gordon Brown."
