NHS hospital selling cancer drugs abroad says Lamb

Wed, 14 Apr 2010

Its disgraceful that an NHS hospital has been selling drugs abroad for profit when they are now in short supply," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on the Health Service Journal report released today which revealed that cancer drugs which are now in short supply have been sold onto the export market, Norman Lamb said:

Its disgraceful that an NHS hospital has been selling drugs abroad for profit when they are now in short supply.

There is a clear need for an investigation into how this happened, why the truth was withheld and whether any laws have been broken.

We urgently need to consider whether there needs to be much stronger sanctions against those who are exporting drugs which contribute to shortages.

The first duty of the NHS must be to care for patients. For a hospital to put profit before care and potentially put lives at risk is shocking.

The Trust involved has failed to live up to the standards that we expect from the NHS.

The supply problems which have been affecting patients and pharmacists are putting real pressure on the NHS and are enormously worrying to patients who need these vital drugs.
