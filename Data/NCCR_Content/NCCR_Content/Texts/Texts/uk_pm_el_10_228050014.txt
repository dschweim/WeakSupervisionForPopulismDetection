Party Manifesto: Green (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

crime
Crime, and fear of crime, blight too manylives, especially in many of our poorest andmost deprived neighbourhoods. No oneshould have to live in fear of street gangs,nor endure robberies or burglary, and shopsshould not be faced with constant shoplifting.Nor should we tolerate white-collar crimeor internet fraud.To deal with crime we have to address why itoccurs and what to do when it does. On thecauses of crime we must first recognise thatthere is more crime in more unequal societies,and that by making our society more equal inthe ways set out in this manifesto we will alsomake it safer. Second, we must act on the factthat over half of all crime is caused one wayor another by misuse of Class A drugs, mainlyheroin or crack cocaine. Radical reform ofour drug laws will massively cut crime.Making our streets safer through lower speedlimits will foster community and indirectlycut crime. Finally, much crime is committedby young people, especially young men,and we need specifically to address this.What to do after a crime has been committedis important too. Simply expensively imprisoningoffenders, often without any remedialwork, is worse than useless. The victim mustcome first, though, and we would introduce asystem of restorative justice, where the onusis on the offender to restore the position ofthe victim as far as possible to where it wasbefore the crime took place. Of course weaccept that there will be some recalcitrant orviolent criminals who will refuse this approach,and for them other options, leading up toimprisonment, will continue to be required.Being safe, being secureTo address the causes of crime we would:• Treat heroin and crack addiction as ahealth issue and not wait for them to becomea crime problem.We would offer treatmentsthat may include prescription of heroin thusremoving the cause of most petty drug-relatedcrime carried out by the addicts and removingthe market from heroin dealers.• Concentrate police and customs resourceson the large-scale production, importationand marketing of these drugs.
• Take the £4bn a year illicit trade incannabis away from criminal street gangs,by decriminalising its possession, sale andproduction, and by introducing a properlyregulated trade with clear age limits.• Give young people better things to do bydoubling expenditure on local authorityyouth services, spending a further £1bn paon ensuring universal access to qualityfacilities for music, art, drama, danceand youth clubs, as well as sports.• Restrict police use of random stop andsearch powers, which damage police andyouth relations.• Improve the design of our cities to providesafer streets and public spaces.• Focus on crime prevention measures,including more community policing underlocal democratic control, more local policestations, and the return of bus conductorsand others who have an important effecton social order.
• Save £2.5bn per annum by not havingID cards, which are an unnecessary invasionof our privacy and will do nothing to preventcrime and terrorism.• Provide proper funding for Women’sRefuges for victims of domestic violence.After crimes have occurred we would:• Look to establish restorative justice as a keyfeature of the UK criminal justice system.While denouncing the crime, this dealsconstructively with both the victim and theoffender. As a result, we would drasticallyreduce the numbers sent to prison, savingup to £8bn over the next Parliament.• Provide reading and writing courses forUK prisoners (two-thirds of UK prisonershave literacy skills below those of an11-year-old).• Repair damage done to public amenitiesand spaces promptly.• Continue to oppose the use of the deathpenalty abroad.

Youth policy• A doubling of the current investment in young people. This will mean an increase from thecurrent £98 spent per person aged 13–19 per annum on out-of-school services to justunder £200. This would come at an estimated cost of £1bn.• The creation of 2000 Young People’s Centres (YPCs). Dedicated spaces for young people tomeet and be creative. The centres would also offer access to information and specialistsupport for teenagers in difficulty.• The creation of a national lead body to regulate youth clubs and YPCs.• A UK-wide Young People’s Executive Council scheme will give representatives aged 11–17(elected by voters aged 11–18) executive control over a small chunk of their localcouncil’s budget (£25,000), which will be a designated youth fund.• Every young person under the age of 18 and in full time education should be entitled tofree off-peak bus fares, to encourage public transport habits in young people early on witha view to making this a behaviour for life.• Raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years old. Reform of the judicial systemto create a strong statutory presumption against the imprisonment of young offenders.• Fashion industry ban on size 0 models to reduce pressure on girls to conform to anunhealthy and unrealistic ideal.• National youth volunteering programme for every young person under the age of 18,fostering intergenerational community cohesion, as well as generating money forthe economy.
