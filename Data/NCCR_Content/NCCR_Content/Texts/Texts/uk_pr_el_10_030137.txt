Press Release from Party: SNP

Championing Commonwealth Games investment
Mon, 26/04/2010 - 15:25

SNP Depute Leader and Deputy
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today (Monday) joined SNP Glasgow East
candidate John Mason to outline the SNP's 
commitment to investment in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and ensuring a
lasting legacy for the East End and for Scotland.

In the SNP's Westminster manifesto, the SNP also pledges to lead cross
party calls for the return of 150 million of lottery cash diverted to
the London Olympics to ensure substantial and sustained investment in
the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

The Scottish Government is funding 80% of the games and supporting
Scotlands champions as they prepare for the Games, to build a strong
sporting and cultural legacy for the community and the country.

Commenting, Ms Sturgeon:

"Just as our athletes are working hard to be Scotland's champions at the
Commonwealth games, so SNP candidates across the country are campaigning
to become local and national champions for Scotland's communities.

In the next parliament, SNP MPs will lead efforts to inspire a new
generation of Scottish champions. Meanwhile the Scottish Government is
funding 80% of the Commonwealth Games and related construction which -
alongside infrastructure improvements and new housing for athletes - is
providing much needed employment in Glasgow through this recession.

With local champions like SNP candidate, John Mason, supporting
investment, and national champions like medal hopeful, Robbie Renwick,
providing real medal hopes for Scotland, Scotland has a winning
combination for a true sporting future.

SNP Candidate for Glasgow East, John Mason added:

"The Commonwealth Games is a great opportunity for Scotland not just in
2014 but to build an amazing legacy for Glasgow East and for Scotland.
That's why the SNP is committed to ensuring Scotland can benefit from
150 million of lottery money that could turn a good legacy into a great
legacy."
