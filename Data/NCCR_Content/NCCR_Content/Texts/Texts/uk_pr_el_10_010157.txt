Press Release from Party: LibDem

People deserve the truth on NHS cuts says Lamb

Mon, 26 Apr 2010

"Liberal Democrats will save billions of pounds by decentralising power, getting bureaucrats out of the NHS and helping underperforming Trusts to achieve the standards of the best," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on todays Royal College of Nursing survey which found that that cuts to services and staff are now becoming a reality across the NHS, Norman Lamb said:

There is now overwhelming evidence that significant cuts to NHS staff and services are underway.

Labour desperately doesnt want this to be an election issue so they are refusing to tell people the truth about whats really going on.

Its incredibly short-sighted to think the only way to save money in the NHS is to slash and burn services. We know from past experience that this will cost more money in the long term.

It doesnt have to be like this. Liberal Democrats will save billions of pounds by decentralising power, getting bureaucrats out of the NHS and helping underperforming Trusts to achieve the standards of the best.
