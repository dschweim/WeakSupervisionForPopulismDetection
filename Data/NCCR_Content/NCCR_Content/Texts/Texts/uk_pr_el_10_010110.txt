Press Release from Party: LibDem

Poorest pay more in tax, richest less under Labour says Clegg

Mon, 12 Apr 2010

The Liberal Democrats will today unveil evidence that the poorest 20% of people are losing more of their income in tax than they did in 1997, while the richest 20% are paying less.

Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg will reveal further details of his partys manifesto pledge for a 17bn tax switch to help rebalance Labours unfair tax system, putting 700 into the pockets of millions of people on low and middle incomes by raising the personal allowance to 10,000.

The income tax cuts will be paid for by closing loopholes that unfairly benefit those at the top, a crackdown on tax avoidance, a new mansion tax and higher aviation duties.

Commenting, Nick Clegg said:

On the day Labour launches its manifesto, this is damning evidence that after 13 years they have failed to deliver fair taxes. Despite everything they said in 1997, life has got harder for people at the bottom and easier for people at the top.
    
All the promises of fairness in Labours manifesto should be taken with a barrelful of salt. They cannot be trusted. This is yet another manifesto for an unfair Britain.

Only the Liberal Democrats have a plan to radically rebalance the tax system to make it fair for all. We will ensure no-one pays tax on the first 10,000 they earn, paid for in full by closing loopholes that unfairly benefit the wealthy, the biggest-ever clampdown on tax avoidance, a new mansion tax and higher aviation duties.

Our plans would be the biggest overhaul of British taxes since the Second World War.
