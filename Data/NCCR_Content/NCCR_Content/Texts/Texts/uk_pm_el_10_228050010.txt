Party Manifesto: Green (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

services
Promoting localism, efficiencyand accessWe would:• Reopen those Post Offices that misguidedGovernment policy has shut down, andeventually increase their number.We wouldset aside £1bn per year to subsidise the localPost Office network.• Encourage a new, local and mutual financialsector, based on trust rather than greed, andincluding community banks, credit unions,local exchange schemes and local currencies.We would provide initial funding of£2.5bn over the next Parliament to assistcommunities in setting up such a network.• End ‘contracting out’ and the PrivateFinance Initiative (PFI). Restore the idea ofcommitment to public trades and industries.Dedicated staff providing a public service aremuch more likely to deliver a good servicethan agency staff with poor work contractsand a high turnover.• Support local shops through planningpolicies including business conservationareas, ensuring basic shops are availablewithin walking distance in all urban areasand restricting the power of supermarkets.• Preserve smaller local schools and libraries,hospitals and other health facilities.• Ensure that public transport provides accessto local facilities.• Support local markets giving access tolocal food.• Encourage local live performance in thearts by moving funding from the regional tothe local level and modifying regulations sothat small-scale live performance in pubs andsimilar venues is not stifled.
