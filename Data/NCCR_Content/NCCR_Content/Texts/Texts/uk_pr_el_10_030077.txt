Press Release from Party: SNP

Elaine C Smith to host town hall meetings
Sun, 11/04/2010 - 09:58

Voters across the country will have the chance to Ask Alex directly in a series of town hall meetings in key constituencies.

The events, to be hosted by famous Scottish actress and comedienne Elaine C Smith, are a key part of the SNPs election strategy as the partys local and national champions put themselves before the public.

Four 'Ask Alex' events will take place over the course of the General
Election campaign in Gordon, Livingston, Dundee and Glasgow.

Ms Smith said:

"Viewers and voters in Scotland will be shouting at the telly during the TV debates as London politicians talk about issues that just arent relevant in Scotland.

Ill be bringing the First Minister to the people so they can quiz him
directly on the issues that matter to them.

And where the TV stations wont let you laugh or clap this will be the audiences show as much as anyone elses.

Mr Salmond said:

Im delighted that one of Scotlands best known and best loved talents has decided to host these events. Im sure Elaine wont let me off lightly!

While the London Parties are engaged in a phoney war the SNP are putting local communities first.  These events  present an ideal opportunity to speak to real people in real communities during the campaign.

I want to hear what people have to say as I make the case for the SNPs local and national champions.
