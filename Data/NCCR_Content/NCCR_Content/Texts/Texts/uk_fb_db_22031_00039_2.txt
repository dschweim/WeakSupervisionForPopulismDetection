We have today unveiled plans to establish a £2.5bn "Care Closer to Home" fund to help people stay healthier for longer and avoid hospital admissions.

Under our manifesto plans, we would invest £500m a year to safeguard the NHS by providing care to people in their own homes, GP surgeries, care homes and community clinics.

Measures would allow GP surgeries to work together to provide care traditionally given in hospitals, such as X rays and other tests in their practices, so that patients do not have to travel into hospital.

There would also better health care in care homes so that older people do not need to go into hospital unnecessarily.
