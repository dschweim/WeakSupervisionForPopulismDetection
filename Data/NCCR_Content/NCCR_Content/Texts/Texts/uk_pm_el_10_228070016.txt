Party Manifesto: UKIP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

12 Transport
UKIP believes the British people have a right to a reliable public and private transport system at an acceptable cost. UKIP will invest in a transport network that meets the needs of the British people and Britain’s economy. UKIP will:· Invest an extra £3 billion p.a. in the UK’s transport infrastructure, using money made available by leaving the EU and saving the £6.4 billion net Britain pays every year in EU membership contributions· Invest in an enhanced and safer road network, building new bypasses and widening major roads· Offer a ‘Windfall Return’ on fuel duty above a set world dollar oil price. When this level is reached, government receipts from oil duties will be returned to motorists as fuel tax cuts· Be fair to motorists by subjecting parking charges and revenue-raising devices, including speed cameras, to greater democratic control· Repeal EU-generated road directives thatimpose unnecessary and expensive burdens, such as the new Road Transport Directive· Introduce a ‘Britdisc’ which foreign lorries will have to pay for using major British roads.Currently, many of these lorries pay nothing for the wear and tear they cause· Veto EU attempts to force the UK into accepting EU lorries that are a third longer and a third heavier than currently allowed - up to an unacceptable 60 tonnes· Invest in three new 200mph plus high-speed rail lines including a new line between London
and Newcastle with a spur to Manchester, a London-Bristol-Exeter line and a linking route via Birmingham· Expand the rail network by re-opening rail lines where there is a proven need· Improve passenger rail franchises by demanding higher standards of customer satisfaction, and by extending standard franchise terms to up to 20 years to encourage greater investment and stability· Encourage a major transfer of freight away from road and onto rail and canal· Invest in better rail and road links to ports· Oppose a sixth Heathrow Airport terminal and third runway and the expansion ofGatwick and Stansted in favour of a major new Hong Kong-style Thames Estuary airport with motorway connections and a high-speed rail service to London, the UK and the ContinentDownload the full Transport policy from the Policies section of www.ukip.org
