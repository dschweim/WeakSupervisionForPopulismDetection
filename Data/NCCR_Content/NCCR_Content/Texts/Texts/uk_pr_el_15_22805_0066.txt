17 April 2015

In the run up to the General Election we will be giving you the opportunity to get to know some of our candidates. Our key candidates and spokespeople can be found here.

This year we will be standing in over 90% of seats in England and Wales.

Our featured candidate for Broxtowe: David Kirwan

Why are you standing for the Green Party in Broxtowe?

I am standing to offer a real alternative for voters faced with re-electing the last MP or the one before that. I'm offering an alternative to austerity and protection of the Green belt in Broxtowe.

What are your three top priorities if elected?

NHS – defending it from privatisation
Local development – protecting greenbelt in the constituency from development
HS2 – opposing the investment in HS2 and the disastrous plans for a hub in our area

What made you want to get involved in politics?

I have always been involved in politics since a young teenager, I want to help make a society that is fair for all and feel if you don't stand up and be counted then nothing will change.

What's your favourite thing about your constituency?

It's diversity- from the bustling university area of Beeston to the quiet tranquillity of Kimberley. Browtowe offers so much.

Who is your political hero?

Predictable, but Tony Benn!
