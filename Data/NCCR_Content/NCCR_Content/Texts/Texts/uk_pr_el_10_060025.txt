Conservative tax reform to aid self employed
Wednesday, March 31 2010
Mark Prisk

Mark Prisk, the Shadow Business Minister, has announced that a Conservative Government would undertake a full and fundamental review of small business taxation, including IR35.

The aim will be to provide a simpler, clearer and lasting tax regime, so businesses can plan with confidence.

"For the last 13 years, Labour have constantly meddled with the tax rules for freelancers and self-employed, Prisk said. "IR35 has especially proved to over-complex, uncertain and often unfair".

IR35 has cost business 73 million over 10 years but it has barely raised revenue for the Treasury. Prisk criticised Gordon Brown for making it harder to be self-employed at a time when Britain should be open for business.

"This is why a Conservative Government would mandate the independent Office of Tax Simplification to undertake a fundamental review of current arrangements with the aim of providing a clearer, lasting and fairer tax regime".

This announcement is in addition to previous pledges to simplify the tax system, cut Corporation Tax for small firms, and make small business rate relief automatic.

"Small businesses cannot afford 5 more years of Gordon Brown", Prisk added. "Only the Conservatives have the energy and the ideas to get Britain working by boosting enterprise".
