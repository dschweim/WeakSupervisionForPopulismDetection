Press Release from Party: LibDem

In 24 hours we can change Britain forever says Nick Clegg

Wed, 05 May 2010

In your heart of hearts you know that if either of the two old parties win this election, nothing will really change," said the Liberal Democrat Leader.

Addressing a rally in Eastbourne this morning, Nick Clegg will say:

In 24 hours we can change Britain forever.

Change is possible and change is coming, if you choose it.

Your vote can make the difference.

In your heart of hearts you know that if either of the two old parties win this election, nothing will really change.

Youve been let down by them a hundred times before, you know how little to expect.

We cannot let that happen.

We cannot let politics as usual triumph.

We can choose something different this time and we will choose something different this time.

If change is what you want, dont let anything or anyone stand in your way.

It may be just a small cross on the ballot paper but it is a big opportunity.

Yours may be just one vote but it could be the one that makes the difference: so use it.
