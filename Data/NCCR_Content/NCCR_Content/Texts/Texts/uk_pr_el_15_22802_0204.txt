    Response to Nigel Farage’s comments this morning

    Jon Trickett, Labour’s Shadow Minister without Portfolio, in response to Nigel Farage’s comments this morning, said:

    “Nigel Farage has been clear: UKIP is actively seeking a post-election Coalition with the Tories.

    “People should be in no doubt, UKIP are more Tory than the Tories – they share Tory beliefs, they share Tory people and now we know from Nigel Farage that they share the same aim: a Tory government.

    “A vote for UKIP is a vote for privatisation of the health service, it’s a vote for another tax break for millionaires while working families’ budgets suffer and it’s a vote for David Cameron in Downing Street.”
