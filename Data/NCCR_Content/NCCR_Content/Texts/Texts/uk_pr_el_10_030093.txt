Press Release from Party: SNP


Debate proves why Scotland needs champions
Thu, 15/04/2010 - 22:36

SNP Leader and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has said the first Leaders' Debate on the 2010 General Election proved why Scotland needs champions.

All the debate confirmed was that the London parties plan deep cuts to Scotlands budget and public services. Thats why Scotland needs local and national champions in the House of Commons to break through this cosy Westminster consensus and win a better deal for Scotland.

Over half the debate should have been captioned Except for viewers in Scotland.

It was billed as a historic event but we all got was three Westminster politicians looking the same, sounding the same and saying nothing of relevance to Scotland.

From Wick to Whitburn, viewers would be turned off by television which simply didnt address the issues which matter to them.
