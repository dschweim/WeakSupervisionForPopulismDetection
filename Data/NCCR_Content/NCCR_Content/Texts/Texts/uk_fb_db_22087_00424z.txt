Excellent article setting out the need for agroecology - and how we can't continue industrial agriculture
The bad news
At the outbreak of World War II,  with 1 energy calorie or 4.2 joules of energy, one could produce 2.3 food calories. In 2009, with increased use of technology, we needed 7.4 energy calories or 31 joules to produce 1 food calorie. 
The good news
A garden area of a quarter acre was carved out and planted using the most advanced permaculture techniques. In a single year, this plot produced €52,000 ($57,200) worth of output for 1,400 hours of work, for an effective salary of €20 ($22) an hour.
