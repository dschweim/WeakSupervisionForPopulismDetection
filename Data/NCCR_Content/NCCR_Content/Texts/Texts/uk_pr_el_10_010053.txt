Press Release from Party: LibDem

Liberal Democrats will help 1m disabled people with their fuel bills

Wed, 24 Mar 2010

The Liberal Democrats have set out plans to extend the Winter Fuel Payment (WFP) to up to 1 million people with severe disabilities and terminal illness.

Severely disabled adults, children and those who are terminally ill are more likely to live in poverty and many struggle to pay higher fuel bills.

The Liberal Democrats will give them 200 to help with their heating bills every year.

The plans would be paid for by increasing the age of eligibility for the WFP to 65 immediately.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Steve Webb said: 
 
The Government has failed to break the link between disability and poverty.

Our plans mean that up to 1m disabled people and those who are terminally ill will get 200 to help pay their heating bills.

Only the Liberal Democrats will extend fuel payments to support those who are most in need.
