Press Release from Party: UKIP

Nigel Farage talks straight on immigration

Tuesday, 4th May 2010

Immigration was debated on BBC2s Daily Politics show today, with only UKIPs Nigel Farage speaking with clarity and conviction on an issue that the majority of the British population rate as a top concern.

The Tuesday lunchtime debate also featured bickering between Labours discredited immigration minister, Phil Woolas, shadow immigration minister Damian Green and Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Tom Brake.

Outlining the Partys proposals for a strict new system of work permits, to follow an immediate five-year freeze on immigration, Mr Farage said: We cannot have a workable immigration policy and be a member of the EU  a fact they [the other three parties] have all ignored.

None of them have told us that they all want Turkey to be a member!

And speaking in his closing statement, Mr Farage explains how UKIP does not object to being friendly with European countries, but believes that Britains infrastructure needs time to recover from the damage done by the badly-controlled immigration policies of successive Conservative and Labour governments.

Lets put British people first. Only UKIP is brave enough to say that, Mr Farage concluded.
