Party Manifesto: Green (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

How we would pay for our programme
There are many spending commitments in this manifesto. And there are proposals for new and increased taxes(see pages 14–16). Does it all add up, and in particular will they in total more than halve the deficit by 2013–14?In summary terms ,our plans, compared to those of the Labour Government (as announced in the BudgetReport 2010), are as follows (all in 2010 real terms):
item1 Labour Government planned public expenditure2 Labour Government anticipated tax receipts3 Labour Government fiscal deficit to borrow*4 Green Party proposed basic public expenditure5 Net additions to public expenditure in this manifesto6 Total Green Party proposed public expenditure**7 Green Party anticipated tax receipts on existing Government tax plans8 Net additional taxation proposed in this manifesto9 Total Green Party proposed taxation†10 Green Party proposed fiscal deficit to borrow‡Notes: * Item 1 – item 2. ** Item 4 + item 5. †Item 7 + item 8. ‡Item 6 – item 9. Figures might not add upexactly due to rounding. In item 7, the Green Party figure for tax receipts on existing tax policies in 2013 islower than that for the Labour Government assumption in item 2 as we assume a lower rate of GDP growth.Notice that Green Party borrowing plans in item 10 are lower than the Labour government plans in item 3

We would freeze basic Government spending at £704bn (item 4 above). Our programme of additionalspending and selected cuts (set out below) would add £72bn in 2010 rising to £80bn in 2013 (item 5 above).We believe that the Government’s projections for GDP growth are too high, and that tax receipts on existingpolicies in 2013 will be only £603bn (item 7 above), £14bn less than the Government’s assumed £617bn(item 2 above).On Government spending we have first of all a modest programme of savings totalling £20bn in 2010 risingto £28bn in 2013. We would save £8bn on defence in 2010 falling to £6bn in 2013 (including cutting Trident;see page 43), £1bn initially rising to £3bn on road-building (page 38), £2.5bn on ID cards and £0.5bn risingto £1.5bn on prisons (pages 24 and 26). We believe modest cumulative annual efficiency savings of 0.5% on60% of Government spending are possible, saving £2.3bn in 2010 rising to £9.4bn in 2013. In addition ourminimum wage policy would save about £6bn a year on tax credits throughout the period.Apart from Citizen’s Pension we have a programme of additional expenditure totalling £52bn rising to £64bnin 2013. The major items are a £20pw rise in Child Benefit (£14bn; page 13), investment in public transport(£4bn, rising to £5bn; page 38), social housing and right to rent (£4bn; page 20), elderly care (£3bn in 2010rising to £8bn by 2013; page 22), renewables and insulation (£5bn rising to £10bn in 2013; pages 20, 35), anincrease in the aid budget (£3bn in 2010 rising to £4.5bn; page 48), training and community programmes forthe unemployed (£5bn, but unnecessary by 2013; page 10), investment in waste management (£3bn pa; page26), abolition of higher education fees (£1.8bn in 2010, but £3.6bn in later years; page 21), and about £9bnrising to £12bn for the 14 smaller commitments, all of which involve £1bn or less in 2010.In terms of public expenditure, Citizen’s Pension will cost an extra £40bn rising to £44bn, so the overallincrease in public expenditure will be £40bn (Citizen’s Pension) plus £52bn (gross cost of manifesto) less£20bn (public expenditure savings), or £72bn (as in item 5 above). The comparable figure for 2013 is £80bn.On taxation our proposals are set out on pages 14 to 16, where it is clear that together with the tax changeson Citizen’s Pension these proposals will add £73bn in 2010 and £112bn in 2013 (item 8 above).
