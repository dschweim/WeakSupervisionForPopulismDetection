Press Release from Party: SNP

Championing new social housing
Tue, 04/05/2010 - 16:51

Joe Fitzpatrick MSP has today (Tuesday) welcomed
the start of work on the first new council houses to be built in Dundee
for twenty years.  

The building programme at Mains Loan South was opened today by
Scottish Government Housing Minister Alex Neil. The development will
consist of seven new family homes and three accessible houses for
wheelchair-users, and Dundee City Council has announced plans to build a
further 60 new homes in the area.  

SNP MSP for Dundee West Mr Fitzpatrick said: 

"The
start of a new era of council house building in Dundee is a cause for
celebration. Thanks to an SNP government that has made it a priority to
provide a new generation of council housing, and an SNP-led council that
has enthusiatically embraced that opportunity, the shortage of
affordable homes in the city is finally being addressed.  

"These new houses will be built to the highest modern
standards, providing tenants with noise insulation, energy efficiency,
lower carbon emissions and lower fuel bills. Disabled people and carers
in Dundee will also be delighted to hear of the council's commitment to
build more accessible homes, designed to make independent living as easy
as possible.  

"Dundee City Council's house-building programme will also create
jobs and provide much-needed support for the construction industry in
the city.  

"In the last year, the SNP has provided local
authorities with 75 million to build 2,300 new council houses and our
planned radical legislation to end the right to buy for new social
housing will ensure that those new homes remain affordable, accessible
and available for future generations. It is an achievement that will
provide lasting benefits for people in Dundee and and across
Scotland."
