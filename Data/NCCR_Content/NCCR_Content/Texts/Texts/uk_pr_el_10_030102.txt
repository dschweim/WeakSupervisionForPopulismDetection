Press Release from Party: SNP

LibDems hiding half their tax plans
Sat, 17/04/2010 - 13:44

Commenting on the Lib Dem's 'fair tax' photo opp today the SNP's election campaign co-ordinator, Stewart Hosie, said:

"The LibDems aren't being completely honest. They are hiding half their tax plan - the half that was exposed only yesterday in the Scottish Parliament and would be deeply damaging for jobs and small businesses in Scotland.

"No wonder they were launching this campaign in a supermarket, because their total tax package would see supermarkets pay less and tens of thousands of small businesses paying much, much more.

"Their proposals on tax hikes for small business are highly damaging and would put at risk jobs all across the country. They would cost small and medium sized businesses a massive 75 million this year."

Notes

In yesterday's Scottish Parliament debate it was pointed out that the LibDem's proposals for a transitional relief scheme similar to that which was introduced in England, many businesses here would have lost out. The small and medium-sized business sector would have ended up subsidising the public sector and some key large industries by almost 75 million.
