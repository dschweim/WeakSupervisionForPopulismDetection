Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Green Action

Greening the Budget

We will publish a full ‘Green Budget’ assessment of every budget. This will ensure that environmental priorities are at the heart of government spending plans, and that the Chancellor is held to account for making economic policy more sustainable.

Making the Polluter Pay

We regard it as essential to make a major shift in taxation from ‘goods’ like wealth creation which benefit Britain to ‘bads’ which are harmful like pollution. We also want to support green technology and new environmental industries. We will establish a Green Tax Commission to make clear recommendations on reforming the tax system, guaranteeing that increases in environmental taxes will be matched by tax cuts elsewhere. Green taxation will involve taxing differently, not taxing more.
