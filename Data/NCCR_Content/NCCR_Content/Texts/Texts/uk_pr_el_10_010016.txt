Press Release from Party: LibDem

 Cutting too soon will aggravate unemployment says Cable

Mon, 15 Mar 2010

"If any Government tries to cut back too soon, it will aggravate unemployment, making the deficit worse and compounding the countrys problems," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Responding to the Bank of Englands latest quarterly bulletin and its warnings of job market uncertainty, Vince Cable said:

This is strong confirmation from the Bank of England that the British economy is still weak.

Although unemployment is not as bad as it could have been given the extent of the economic collapse, there is still worrying uncertainty.

The clear implication of the Banks analysis is that if any Government tries to cut back too soon, it will aggravate unemployment, making the deficit worse and compounding the countrys problems.

Each party must set out a clear process of what and how it will cut to tackle the deficit, but when this starts must be guided by economics, not political dogma.
