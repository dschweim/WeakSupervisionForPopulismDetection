-------------
This has been an historic Government, one formed at a time of national emergency to rescue an economy on the brink of disaster.
 
Together, we have turned the economy around to become one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world.
 
That recovery was only possible because the Liberal Democrats put the national interest first at a time of crisis.
 
But this Government has also done something else that is truly historic. It has shown that the give and take of two different parties working together, with two different sets of values and priorities, can be a very British way of getting things done.
 
With Liberal Democrats around the cabinet table we have been able to do many things that have made British society fairer, that the Conservatives alone would not have done.
 
We have cut taxes for millions of working people and lifted the lowest paid out of tax altogether; we have directed more funding to the poorest children in our schools; we have created a record 2m apprenticeships.
 
I believe that the era of single party government in the United Kingdom is over.
 
Thanks to the Liberal Democrats, the next government will inherit a Britain with a stronger economy and a fairer society.
 
It is only with the Liberal Democrats in government again that we can keep the recovery on track and ensure both stability and fairness in the next five years.
 
Thats the message I will be taking around the country between now and May 7th.
 
I am extremely proud of what the Liberal Democrats have done and I intend to shout it from the rooftops.
