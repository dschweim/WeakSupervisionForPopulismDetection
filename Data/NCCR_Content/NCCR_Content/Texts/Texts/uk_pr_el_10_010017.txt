Ed Balls posturing on schools budget is not serious says Laws

Mon, 15 Mar 2010

This is a pretty desperate attempt from Ed Balls to re-package existing deprivation funding for schools," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Schools Secretary.

Commenting on the Governments launch of a consultation on the future of schools funding, David Laws said:
 
This is a pretty desperate attempt from Ed Balls to re-package existing deprivation funding for schools.
 
What is missing is any suggestion of additional money.

Since it would be politically impossible to cut the budgets of some schools to shift money to others, what Ed Balls is talking about is political posturing not serious policy.
