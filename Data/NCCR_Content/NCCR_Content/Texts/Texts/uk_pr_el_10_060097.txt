David Cameron has launched the Conservative Party's contract for Northern Ireland.

Speaking in County Down, he said he wanted to give voters in Northern Ireland "the right to vote for a party capable of forming the government of our United Kingdom".

"I know that for many years people in Northern Ireland felt cut off from the rest of the United Kingdom, including from the government", he said. "I want to end that sense of isolation".

He said this election presents "a new opportunity to participate in the mainstream of British politics" for Northern Ireland, so that "mainstream politics that are decided in Westminster yet affect every single person in Northern Ireland are part of the mainstream political debate".

Cameron went on to commit to funding Northern Ireland according to its needs, to look into turning it into an enterprise zone, and to ban the "double-jobbing" of its MPs.
