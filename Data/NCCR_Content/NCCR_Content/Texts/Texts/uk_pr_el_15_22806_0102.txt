Our plan to make sure work is always rewarded
Post date: 29/04/2015

With David Cameron and the Conservatives, work will always be rewarded:

    Nobody working 30 hours on minimum wage will ever pay income tax
    The tax-free personal allowance will rise to £12,500 by 2020
    The 40p tax threshold will increase to £50,000 by 2020 - and will always rise at least in line with inflation
    Your family home will be taken out of inheritance tax by lifting the threshold for married couples to £1m

We will also introduce a five year tax lock, meaning that between May 2015 and May 2020 there will be:

    No increases in income tax rates
    No increases in VAT - nor an extension of its scope
    No increases in National Insurance - nor an increase in its ceiling

There's a clear choice on tax at this election.

One one side, David Cameron and the Conservatives, with a clear plan to keep our economy strong and cut your taxes.

On the other, Ed Miliband - propped up by the SNP - who would wreck the economy with more borrowing, unlimited benefits and higher taxes.
