Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Education and Employment

Investment in education –

for all our futures

High quality education is the key to personal freedom. We believe that every child matters. Education provides the freedom to choose a fulfilling job, the freedom to exploit one's talents to the full, and the freedom to contribute fully to society. Education is also the key to Britain’s future prosperity.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Cut class sizes to 25 on average for 5-11 year-olds

    Recruit 5000 extra secondary school teachers to reduce class sizes for 11-16 year-olds

    Increase funding for books and equipment in schools

    Cut bureaucracy in schools and interfere less in the professional judgements of teachers

    Abolish university tuition fees

Britain has been held back by under-investment in education. Children from poorer families have been particularly ill-served. The Conservatives failed to fund schools and colleges adequately. Labour have done far too little to put things right. In schools, they have invested in paperwork rather than people, demoralising teachers and wasting resources by creating a mountain of extra bureaucracy. In the Higher Education sector, they have made matters worse by introducing university tuition fees.

We are clear about our goals and determined to reach them. Our plans will cost around £3 billion extra each year. We guarantee to introduce the extra funding needed at the beginning of the next Parliament, irrespective of short-term economic growth. We will put an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax to meet this commitment. Growth in the future may allow us to be more ambitious still.

We believe that most day-to-day decision-making in education is best done by teachers, schools and local authorities, not by central government.
