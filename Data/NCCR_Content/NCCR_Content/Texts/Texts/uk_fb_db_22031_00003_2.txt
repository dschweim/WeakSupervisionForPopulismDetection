-------------
Today you have to make one of the most important political decisions of your lives. The stakes could not be any higher.
Our economic recovery is at risk. 
Our shared British values of generosity and tolerance are at threat and there is a risk our United Kingdom will be pulled apart.
The choice you make today will decide whether we stay on track or whether we allow the right or the left to pull us to the extremes. 
Every vote that you cast for the Liberal Democrats, every Liberal Democrat MP that is returned to Parliament will be dedicated to three simple aims. Stability - we won't allow excessive cuts or reckless borrowing. Decency - we won't allow our society to be divided by fear. Unity - we will fight against those who want to pull our wonderful United Kingdom apart. #GE2015
