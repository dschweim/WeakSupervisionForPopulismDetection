For the first time since the 1970s, Britain now sells more cars than it buys thanks to Vince Cable and the Liberal Democrats being in the driving seat at the Department for Business.

However, we need to go further and faster in making Britain a world leader in low emission vehicles by providing the right incentives and infrastructure to attract green investment and green jobs.

This isnt just about re-balancing the economy, its also about tackling dangerous levels of air pollution that reduce average life expectancy by up to 8 months.

Our Liberal Democrat £100m prize fund will spark a low emission car revolution in Britain and help to build a stronger and greener economy for years to come.
