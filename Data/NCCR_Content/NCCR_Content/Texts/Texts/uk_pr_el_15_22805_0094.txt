Greens’ BAME manifesto launched by Green Party Deputy Leader Shahrar Ali

3 May 2015
SHAHRAR Ali, Deputy Leader of the Green Party, today launched the Greens' BAME Manifesto (1) alongside Benali Hamdache, Green Party Equalities spokesperson, and members of the Greens of Colour group. The launch took place at Brick Lane in east London. 
 
The manifesto pledges:
 
•            Anonymised CVs so that BAME candidates are not excluded from jobs
•            More apprenticeships and more funding for BAME entrepreneurs
•            Reform of stop and search
•            Ethical international diplomacy that supports peacebuilding
•            Reform of the asylum process and an end to the spousal income requirement
 
Ali, who is standing in Brent Central at the 2015 General Election, said:
 
“Our society is an international one and we owe a debt to the generations of individuals and families from all over the world who have made the UK what it is today.
 
“The Green Party is presenting a brighter future that tackles systemic inequalities in society and would work to provide everyone an equal stake in life. Talent and energy remain untapped because of inequality, whilst too many communities face poverty, exclusion and marginalisation.
 
“In May 2015 you have a stark choice: to continue with the failed, grey Westminster politics of old, or create a whole new type of politics. Vote Green on May 7th and help start a peaceful political revolution.”
 
The Green Party is polling at record levels ahead of a General Election. Membership of the Green Party, the third largest party in England and Wales, sky-rocketed by 123% in 2014 and continues to surge in 2015. The combined membership of UK Green parties now stands at over 70,000.
 
The Green Party is standing candidates in almost 95% of seats, meaning more people than ever before will be able to vote Green on May 7th 2015.
