Press Release from Party: SNP

SNP offers positive alternative
Wed, 21/04/2010 - 11:11

Following the first televised Scottish debate of the General Election, the SNP's campaign co-ordinator Stewart Hosie said:

"The London parties clung together in this debate as the SNP put forward the only positive alternative for Scotland's voters to the broken Westminster machine.

"Angus Robertson clearly demonstrated the alternative offered by the SNP and the SNP's commitment to supporting the people and communities of Scotland in Westminster as local and national champions.  The London parties had nothing to offer.

"Jim Murphy will not be thanked by Gordon Brown after his admission of "catastrophic errors" in Iraq - a statement that merely confirms what everyone already knows about Labour's appalling foreign policy blunders.

"As the election moves in Scotland's direction, the hostility of UK parties to allowing the people of Scotland to have their voice properly heard in London was breathtaking.  A balanced Parliament offers real opportunity for Scotland not just to elect politicians but to elect local champions."
