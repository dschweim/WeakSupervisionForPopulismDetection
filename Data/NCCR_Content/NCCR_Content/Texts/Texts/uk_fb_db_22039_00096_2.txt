-------------
Today we launched our disability manifesto: A better future for disabled people. I wanted to share the foreword, which I have co-written with Rachel Reeves and Kate Green:
 
The twelve million disabled people in Britain today have a huge contribution to make to our country, and a right to be treated on equal terms with any other citizen. But too many feel left behind by our economy and left out of our politics  at worst, stigmatised and threatened by negative language and a worrying rise in disability hate crime.
 
Former Remploy employees have spoken of their sense of betrayal when the help they were promised to find new jobs never came. Families hit by the Bedroom Tax talk of the desperate choice they face between sinking into debt or losing their home  despite needing all the space they have for carers or medical equipment. Disabled people who excel at difficult and demanding jobs, who are doing all they can to find appropriate work, or who need the protection of our social security system, have told us how angry they feel about sensational media stories that paint those who cannot work as scroungers.
 
Labour is determined to turn this around and make this a country where the voices of disabled people are heard, their contribution is valued, and the right to live a full and fulfilling life is made a reality. 

We are proud that Labour has worked closely with disabled people to identify the issues that most affect their lives, and develop the policies we need to address them. 

This manifesto sets out our plan to continue that work in government.
