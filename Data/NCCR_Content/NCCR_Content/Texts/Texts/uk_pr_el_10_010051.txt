Press Release from Party: LibDem

Woolas either ignorant or deceitful over Yarls Wood says Huhne

Wed, 24 Mar 2010

This is another gaffe from an accident-prone minister," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on immigration minister Phil Woolas statement on Yarls Wood detention centre, where he said the only alternative to child detention was to separate children from their mothers, Chris Huhne said:

This is another gaffe from an accident-prone minister. Either Phil Woolas is ignorant of international experience such as Sweden, or he trying to deceive people into believing that the uncivilised and inhumane practice of locking up children is the only alternative.

Sweden assesses refugee claims without locking up children with all the psychological damage that ensues.

The key to a better alternative is tagging for the adults, restricted movements and regular reporting not putting kids behind bars.

These are some of the people with the lowest likelihood of absconding, as anyone who has tried to make a quick getaway with a toddler in tow will testify."
