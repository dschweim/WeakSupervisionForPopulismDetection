Gordon Brown: Cameron hiding true impact of Child Tax Credit cuts

Gordon BrownFollowing David Camerons misleading claim on Sunday that he would not cut Child Tax Credits from those on incomes below 50,000, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have stepped up Labours attack on the real Tory plan to cut Child Tax Credits from those on much lower incomes.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown, at a stump speech in South London, said:

The Conservatives would cut Child Tax Credits for middle class families. And when we look at the figures, they want to take 400 million away from Child Tax Credits and that means families with incomes above 31,000.

The Chancellor Alistair Darling said:

The IFS criticised David Camerons claims on tax credits as 'incomplete at best and misleading at worst'. As he well knows, the facts show that to raise the 400 millions hes pledged, he will be taking tax credits from families on total household incomes of 31,000  not 50,000 as he has tried to claim. Thats a family of two earners on 16,000 each. Contrary to what David Cameron thinks, these people are not well off. With four days to go before the election, hes got to admit that 1.3 million households on modest and middle incomes will lose up to 10 a week if he gets into office.
