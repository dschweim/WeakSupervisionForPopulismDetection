Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour and Tories have blocked political reform says Clegg

Wed, 07 Apr 2010

"Both of them would do anything to protect the corrupt two-party stitch up and secrecy of Westminster," the Liberal Democrat Leader will say.

Speaking in a press conference before the last Prime Ministers Questions of this Parliament, Nick Clegg will say:

In the campaign over the next four weeks you will hear a lot about political reform. David Cameron will talk about cutting the cost of politics. Gordon Brown will talk about reforming the Lords.

Their words are a smokescreen for the truth: Both of them would do anything to protect the corrupt two-party stitch up and secrecy of Westminster.

Thats the reason theyve blocked serious reform every step of the way  to keep things exactly the way they are.

If Labour and the Conservatives get their way, the Parliament returned on 6 May will be no different from the one being dissolved this weekend.

If Labour and the Conservatives get their way, only the faces will change. All the corruption and all the sleaze. All the big money and all the backroom dealings will remain.

Only the Liberal Democrats can be trusted on political reform. Labour and the Conservatives talk about it. We will make sure it happens.

Anyone who needs proof of what Im saying today should turn to the recently published minutes of the Hayden Phillips negotiations on party funding.

They make depressing reading.

A clear demonstration of the petty, venal self-interested way the two old parties behave when the doors are closed.
