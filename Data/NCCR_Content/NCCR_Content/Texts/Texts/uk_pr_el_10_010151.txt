Press Release from Party: LibDem

Real danger of double dip recession says Cable

Fri, 23 Apr 2010

"The worst possible action is the Tory proposal to pull out the drip-feed when the patient is still in a critical condition," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on todays GDP figures showing 0.2% growth between January and March this year, Vince Cable said:

These figures show that the promised recovery is barely visible. There is a real danger of the UK going into a double dip recession. As people deal with their own debts and as the banks continue to strangle good British businesses by starving them of credit the recovery will remain fragile.
 
The British economy has had a massive heart attack  it has just emerged from the intensive care unit into the recovery ward. The worst possible action is the Tory proposal to pull out the drip-feed when the patient is still in a critical condition.
 
Not only must we tackle the deficit in a considered and rational fashion, we must also ensure that we support jobs and infrastructure as well as making sure businesses get the credit they need to drive growth in the economy.
