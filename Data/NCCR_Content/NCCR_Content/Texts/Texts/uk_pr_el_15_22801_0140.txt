Commenting on the Conservatives plans to legislate against tax increase, Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said:

"This is a sign of total desperation from a Tory party now in full panic mode. This is a failed attempt to deflect attention from the fact that their future plans simply don't add up.

"Rather than sticking to a balanced plan, the Tories would inflict on Britain a severe lurch to the right for which millions of working people would pay the price.

"Rather than gimmicks like this, they should have the courage to set out where their £12 billion of welfare cuts will fall. No-one will believe the Tories on tax while they continue to try to con people on spending. 

"In contrast, our Liberal Democrat plans will keep the recovery on track and ensure that fairness remains at the heart of economic policy."
