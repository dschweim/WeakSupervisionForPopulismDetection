Liberal Democrat Leader urges BAME communities to register to vote

Mon, 19 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg has today urged Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to register to vote on the eve of the registration deadline this Tuesday.

Research from the Electoral Commission has showed that the UKs BAME community are among those least likely to be on the electoral register.

And an estimated 17% are not registered and so miss out on voting at local and national elections.

Commenting, Nick Clegg said:

Elections that can really make a difference dont come along very often.

But this is one of them.

In just under three weeks you have an opportunity to shape the future of our country for the better and remind those in power that it is the people of this country who really make the decisions. But you can only do so if you are registered to vote.

If it makes you angry that almost half of all young black people will be unable to get a job, that the already huge pay gap widens massively for BAME women and that a childs chances in life are still determined by their parents bank balance, it is crucial that you get out there and make your voice heard.

This Tuesday will be the last chance to register to vote, so dont settle for low politics and broken promises.

Demand better. Demand change.

Register to vote and make your voice heard.
