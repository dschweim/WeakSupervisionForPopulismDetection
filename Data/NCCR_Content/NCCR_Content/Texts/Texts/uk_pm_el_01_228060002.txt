Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Through our lives

Raising a family

Common sense means strengthening the family

    Less tax for families
    Support for marriage
    Freedom for headteachers and governors to run their own schools
    Power for parents to change management of failing schools
    Endowed universities and less onerous student loan repayments

Families feel more than ever that they are struggling to bring up their children in an environment that is hostile.

They feel it is getting harder to make ends meet, especially when their children are very young. They feel the Government only values childcare if someone else is paid to provide it, and that it doesn't value marriage at all. They feel that they are paying a fortune in tax, but they aren't getting the education they want for their children.

They also worry that, however hard they try to bring up their children well, the dangers of being drawn into crime and drug use are growing. And they fear that passing our values on from one generation to the next is harder than ever.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will help families bringing up children. We will let families keep more of what they earn. We will support marriage. We will provide choice and high standards in schools. And we will help parents who feel they aren't getting enough help at the time they need it the most.

"We will introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance which will give a tax cut worth £1,000 to many families when they need help most.
