Labour falling apart over Trident says Davey

Sun, 18 Apr 2010

There is growing support in the military, and it would seem in corners of the other parties, for alternatives to spending 100bn on a Cold War era nuclear weapons system," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Foreign Secretary.

Commenting on contradictory remarks from Labour Cabinet ministers over Trident replacement, Edward Davey said:

Labour is already falling apart over Trident.

One day the Defence Secretary says it is ridiculous to look at cheaper alternatives to renewing the current system, the next day the Welsh Secretary says affordability should be on the agenda.

There is growing support in the military, and it would seem in corners of the other parties, for alternatives to spending 100bn on a Cold War era nuclear weapons system.
