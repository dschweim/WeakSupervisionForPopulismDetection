CARE SERVICES

Care services for children, the elderly and the handicapped are provided by local government, health authorities, the private sector and voluntary groups, not directly by central government. But government is indirectly involved as the provider of taxpayers money and through its duty to set standards for publicly and privately provided care.

As the number of elderly people in the population grows, there will be more frail and vulnerable citizens who need support. Many of them will want to be cared for at home. Others will need residential or nursing home care. It is vital that people should have choice in the type of care available. In all cases people must be able to rely on the quality of care. As we move towards implementation of 'Caring for People' in April 1993:

    We will take steps to ensure that individuals who need residential or nursing care continue to have a choice of homes, including independent homes. Money transferred from the Social Security budget to local social services departments will be used for this purpose.
    We will ensure that all local authorities publish information about the social services that are available, including information on standards and complaints procedures.
    We will provide choice in domiciliary and day care.
    We will provide further funding for voluntary organisations to play their vital part in the development of community care services.
    We will support the organisations which help those who care for friends and relatives at home.
