Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour has let down unpaid carers say Lamb

Wed, 17 Mar 2010

The Liberal Democrats will guarantee that a million unpaid carers who work the longest hours get a weeks break every year  to be taken in whichever way they choose," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on todays Princess Royal Trust for Carers report, which reveals that next year Primary Care Trusts only plan to spend 25% of the 100m they have been allocated to increase services for carers for this purpose, Norman Lamb said:
 
This report makes clear that Labour has completely let down millions of hardworking unpaid carers across the country.
 
Yet again we see that ministers have chased headlines with grand spending commitments but completely failed to make sure the money gets through to the people who really need it. This is tantamount to a fraud on vulnerable people.
 
The Liberal Democrats will guarantee that a million unpaid carers who work the longest hours get a weeks break every year  to be taken in whichever way they choose. Only a guaranteed right will stop vital funds for respite being diverted into other parts of the NHS.
