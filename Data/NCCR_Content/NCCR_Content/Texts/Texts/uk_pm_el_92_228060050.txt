Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

THE PATIENT'S CHARTER

No one questions the dedication of those who work in the NHS But before the Government's reforms, the system did not always allow that dedication to produce the service which people should be able to expect.

The Patient's Charter sets out clearly what is now expected from the NHS. We have already pledged that in future no one will wait more than two years for treatment on the NHS. In many parts of the country for most treatments, the waiting time is much shorter than this; and we will seek further progress in reducing waiting times.

    Binding guarantees will be set locally for in-patient waiting times, starting with the operations where waiting causes most distress. To ensure that progress on waiting times continues, we intend that from 31 March 1993, no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement, or a cataract operation. We are sure that, as now, many hospitals will be able to do better than this.
    We will move to a system under which a named nurse or midwife will be responsible for your care while you are in hospital.
    We will set specific targets for out patient waiting times.
    We will make it easier for patients to find out what services are available from the NHS via a new national NHS information service.
    We will ensure that comparative information about the health standards achieved by health authorities is available to the public.
    Simple systems will be set up to allow complaints to be registered and responses given if things go wrong.
