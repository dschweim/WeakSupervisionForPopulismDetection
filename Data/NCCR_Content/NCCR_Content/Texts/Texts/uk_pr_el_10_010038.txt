University cuts paving way for tuition fees hike says Williams

Thu, 18 Mar 2010

There is a real fear that these cuts are preparing the ground for tuition fees to be raised," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Universities Secretary.

Commenting on the Governments announcements of cuts to university budgets, Stephen Williams said:

Universities and young people are bearing the brunt of Labours economic failure.

There is a real fear that these cuts are preparing the ground for tuition fees to be raised.  It would be totally unfair for young people, the innocent victims of the financial crisis, to be punished in this way.
