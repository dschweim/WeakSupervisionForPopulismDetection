Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Victims first

Too often criminals seem to enjoy more rights than their victims. Conservatives will make sure that the justice system treats victims fairly.

A named police officer who is working on their case will be identified to each victim, and they will have a similar continuous point of contact in the Crown Prosecution Service. Both the police and the CPS will be required to keep the victim informed as the investigation and prosecution progress and written reasons must be given where charges are dropped or reduced.

We will also overhaul the law so that it is on the side of the victim not the criminal. This will include the law on self defence and the double jeopardy rule.

"Conservatives will increase the number of police officers on our streets"

"We could all make a list of the additional paperwork that creates a bureaucratic nightmare for officers who want to spend more time actually delivering the goods...The situation is far more frustrating nowadays than at any time in my 28 years' service.The public is getting a raw deal." - A Chief Inspector of Police
