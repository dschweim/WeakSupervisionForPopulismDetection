Press Release from Party: LibDem

 Huge school classes must be cut says David Laws

Sat, 03 Apr 2010

Huge classes are more difficult for teachers to control and young children can miss out on the individual attention they need," the Liberal Democrat Shadow Schools Secretary said.

Commenting on the National Union of Teachers call for reducing class sizes to be a top priority for the next Government, David Laws said:

It is disgraceful that thousands of young children are in classes so big that they are illegal.

Huge classes are more difficult for teachers to control and young children can miss out on the individual attention they need.

The Liberal Democrats will give schools the money to cut class sizes and not allow them to grow even bigger.
