Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Living safely

Common sense means having enough police to keep our streets safe and a criminal justice system that reflects our values rather than undermines them

    Increase police numbers
    Free police from bureaucracy so that they can get on with policing
    Take persistent young offenders off our streets
    Criminals to serve the sentence given by the court
    More rights for victim

We may have grown more prosperous as a nation, but the quality of our life is still impoverished by crime.

Decent people, who work hard and who obey the law, are outraged that criminals seem free to make their lives a misery.

Labour have talked tough on law and order but they have failed to deliver. Police numbers have fallen, and violent crime is on the rise.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will trust the instincts of the mainstream majority on law and order. That means more police and less bureaucracy holding them back. It also means tougher sentences for some crimes and more honest sentencing for all crimes.

"It's time to stop turning a blind eye to crimes committed by young offenders and ensure instead that they are put back on the right track."
