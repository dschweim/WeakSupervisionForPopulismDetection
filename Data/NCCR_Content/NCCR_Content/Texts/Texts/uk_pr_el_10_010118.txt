Press Release from Party: LibDem

Tory double standards on double jobbing says Carmichael

Tue, 13 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrat Shadow Scotland Secretary, Alistair Carmichael has today challenged all parties to commit to end double-jobbing in Scotland.

The call follows a commitment in the Conservative manifesto to end the practice in Northern Ireland.

Currently there is no restriction on a person holding a job as both an MP and an MSP and drawing a salary for each. Recent Liberal Democrat measures to bring this to an end were not supported by Labour, the Conservatives or the SNP.

Both Labour and the Tories are standing candidates in the Westminster General Election who are already MSPs, and who have said they will not stand down from either job if they are successful.

Commenting, Alistair Carmichael said:

The Tories are guilty of double standards on double jobbing.

Ending the practice in Northern Ireland while ignoring the problem in Scotland is nonsensical.

We are today calling on all parties to commit to our plans to ensure Scots have full representation at both Holyrood and Westminster.

It is simply unacceptable for MPs to think they can claim two salaries for doing half as much work for their constituents.
