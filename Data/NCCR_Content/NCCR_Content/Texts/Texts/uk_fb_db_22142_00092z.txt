-------------
Yesterday I addressed Labour’s National Women’s Conference along with Emma Meehan, Kate Green, Cat Smith and the Scottish Labour Leader, Kezia Dugdale. 

I'm very proud that hundreds more women have attended this year's conference compared to previous years and likewise, proportionally more women are joining our party than before 12 September.

An inclusive party with mass membership makes us stronger and more able to shape our society.
