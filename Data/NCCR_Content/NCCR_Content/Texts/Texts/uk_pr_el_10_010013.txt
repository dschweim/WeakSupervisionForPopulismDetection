Liberal Democrats pass plans to clean up politics

Sun, 14 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrat Spring Conference today passed plans to clean up politics and urgently create a fairer and more local political system.

The proposals include:
 
 - A fairer voting system
 
 - A requirement for those who stand for Parliament or sit in the House of Lords to pay tax in Britain
 
 - A fully elected second chamber
 
 - The right for voters to sack their MP
 
 Commenting, Liberal Democrat Manifesto Chair, Danny Alexander said:
 
Our broken political system desperately needs to be cleaned up.  Public confidence in politics is at an all time low, and the way the country is governed needs urgent reform.  
 
The Liberal Democrats have passed plans today to make politics fairer, local and more transparent.  
 
Labour has had 13 years to change our broken politics, and its failed to do so.
 
Only the Liberal Democrats would end safe seats, reform the voting system and give local people a real say over how their neighbourhoods are governed.
