Press Release from Party: LibDem

We need a new UN body to break the climate deadlock says Hughes

Sat, 13 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrat Spring Conference today endorsed plans for a new international body to coordinate efforts for a stronger deal on climate change.

The authority would sit in permanent session and bring coherence to efforts to reach a binding and enforceable agreement on emissions cuts.

The motion passed by Conference also:

    Called for a floor price for carbon to stabilise the carbon market and promote higher levels of investment in the low carbon economy
    Reaffirmed the Liberal Democrat commitment to a 40% emissions cut by 2020 and the goals of the 10:10 campaign

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Simon Hughes said:

Theres no question that Copenhagen was a failure of international leadership. But it also exposed the weakness and fragmentation of a bewildering institutional framework.

Getting a good deal on climate change will be all but impossible without a strong world environment body with the clout to bang heads together.

The current mishmash of institutions, agreements and treaties is diluting efforts to make the politics fit the science.

If the WTO can adjudicate on trade disputes, then surely the time has come for a UN body that can break the climate deadlock.
