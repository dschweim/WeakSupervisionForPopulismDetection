Time to Get Tough onCrime and Criminals
• The BNP will end the culture where criminals’ rights are placed above those ofvictims of crime.• The BNP will abolish political correctness from the police service in favour of realcrime fighting.• The BNP will abolish the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) in order toremove unnecessary bureaucracy from the police services’ duties.• The BNP will reintroduce capital punishment for drug dealers, child murderers,multiple murderers, murderers of policemen on duty and terrorists where guilt isproven beyond all doubt.• The BNP will reintroduce the right of householders to defend themselves and theirproperty using whatever means they deem necessary.• The BNP will establish a penal station for extremely dangerous/violent repeatcriminals (including rapists) on the British island of South Georgia.Removing the Politically Correct Straitjacket from the PoliceDespite unprecedented sums spent on the police, Britain today faces recordcriminality levels.Police have been removed from the community. Traditional and effective bobby-on-the-beat policing has been abandoned in favour of ‘Community Support Officers’, patrol cars and expensive and intrusive technological devices such as CCTV.Police management has lost its focus on preventing crime and has become subjected to politically correct social work, more concerned with the rights and ethnicity of criminals than with the rights of victims.This has particularly been the case since the Macpherson Report — a prejudicial, politically correct, left-leaning statement which wrought great damage to traditional policing.We intend to rebuild the social contract where the criminal was afraid of the police and upright citizens were protected by the law.The liberal consensus which confuses the criminal with the victim will be abolished.Politically correct senior police officers will be axed.The BNP shall:- Ensure that the police’s priority be returned to the prevention and detectionof crime.- Return, so far as practicality permits, to traditional foot and cycle patrols.- Reintroduce corporal punishment in instances of vicious criminality and assault.- Reintroduce capital punishment for child murderers, multiple murderers, murderersof policemen on duty and terrorists where guilt is beyond all doubt.- Examine, carefully, the merits of ‘Restorative Justice,’ where fines imposed by thecourts are given in whole or in part to the victims. Criminals will be forced to repairdamage wrought in the community.- Review the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), which introduced anunacceptable tier of bureaucracy on the police in terms of form-filling.- Examine, carefully, the argument that families should bear financial responsibilityfor the cost of crimes committed by those of their children beneath the age of 18.This deterrent would curtail the misconduct of young vandals and criminals. We arewary of the conditions where millions live in fear of crime, much of which iscommitted by a relatively small number of serial offenders who have little fear of thecriminal justice system.- Reintroduce traditional police uniforms and phase out the paramilitary costumesthat have undermined this powerful symbol of traditional unarmed civil authority.The police are the servants of the people, not the servants of the state.- Reintroduce the right of householders to defend themselves and their propertyusing whatever means they deem necessary.- We shall also examine the culture of law enforcement. To this extent, we believe itis proper that adults in a community may, on rare occasions, discipline badly behavedchildren (subject, of course, to common-sense interpretations of Common Law).- Ensure criminals serve their full sentences, with time added for bad conduct. Earlyrelease, embracing 25 percent of the prison sentence, will be permitted in return fora clear demonstration of the acquisition of genuinely useful skills or full rehabilitationin the case of drug addicts. Parole Boards shall possess the authority to releasesuch model prisoners, if necessary by electronic tagging.- Substantially increase the provision for drug rehabilitation. An investment of thisnature will be justified in terms of helping to negate the link between drug use,addiction and criminality.- Introduce the death penalty for the large-scale dealing of hard drugs, when provenbeyond all doubt.- Establish a penal station for hardened and repeat criminals on the British island ofSouth Georgia. To prevent corruption, the prison governor will be changed everysix months and will not qualify to serve a further term for three years. The prisonerswill be used to construct modern port facilities, suitable for fishing vessels.- Introduce physical labour into the prison service, in return for remission for goodconduct. To this extent, there are numerous areas where electronically-taggedphysical labour is required.Two immediate areas include the urgent re-construction of sea defences and,secondly, the placement of fibre-optic cabling in the rural community. These facilities,provided by the Prison Service, will produce a welcome source of revenue.
