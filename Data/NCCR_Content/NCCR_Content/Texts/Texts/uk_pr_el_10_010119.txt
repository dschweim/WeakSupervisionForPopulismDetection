Press Release from Party: LibDem

You cant trust the Conservatives says Alexander

Tue, 13 Apr 2010

The Tories wont make life better for ordinary people. Their manifesto offers only fake change not the real change this country desperately needs," said Nick Cleggs Chief of Staff.

Commenting on todays manifesto launch by the Conservatives, Danny Alexander said:

The truth is that you cannot trust the Conservatives. David Cameron simply believes it is his turn to take over in the same way the two old parties have taken turns for years. Todays manifesto offers the same old empty promises based on the lazy assumption that people will just give them another go.

When the Tories say were all in this together, what they really mean is youre on your own.  Their agenda is to take away help from those who need it and offer it to those already at the top.

The Tories wont make life better for ordinary people. Their manifesto offers only fake change not the real change this country desperately needs.
