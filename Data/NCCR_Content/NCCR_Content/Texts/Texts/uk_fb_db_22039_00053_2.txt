Last night, David Cameron was asked if he is planning to cut Child Benefit. He used 600 words to dodge answering, but he didnt say no. The Tories plan to cut tax credits and Child Benefit are now on the ballot paper. This is our new election poster, please share it so people know what the Tories have planned ?
