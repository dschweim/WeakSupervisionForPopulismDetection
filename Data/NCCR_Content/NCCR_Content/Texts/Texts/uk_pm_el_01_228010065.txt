Defence

We are proud of Britain's record of defending democracy and to remember those who have given their lives, we will make the day after Remembrance Sunday a public holiday. British armed forces rightly enjoy the respect of the world. It is essential to preserve that reputation. But as the country’s own defence capability has shrunk since the end of the Cold War, it has been slow to pool resources with allies. Britain’s capabilities must continue to adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. We will:

    Resist further erosion of Britain’s defence capability. We will maintain the current level of spending and resist any further reductions.

    Promote flexibility, mobility, rapid deployment and joint operations as the basis of Britain’s defence policy, to enable the UK to honour Britain’s commitments to the EU, NATO, the Commonwealth and the UN.

    Promote equal opportunities and family welfare in the armed forces. We will oppose unfair discrimination in the forces. We will review welfare policies in order to set minimum and consistent standards that can be applied at home and abroad for service families.

    Work for the elimination worldwide of all nuclear weapons. We will press for a new round of multilateral arms reduction talks, but will retain the UK's minimum nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future.

    Oppose the National Missile Defence System (NMD). The system currently being proposed by the USA represents a threat to international stability and arms control agreements.

    Put in place a moratorium on the use of Depleted Uranium Shells until there is clear evidence regarding the health risks involved.
