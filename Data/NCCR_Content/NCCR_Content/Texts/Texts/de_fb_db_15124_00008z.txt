With #refugee flows unseen since the Second World War we are faced with a global challenge nation-states are not equipped to deal with on their own. Even less so if every government only focuses on the few miles the refugees make in their respective countries and ignore the rest of the journey. Our joint strategy must be to address every step of the way of the refugee's Odyssey and to come to a comprehensive solution. Getting together European and #Africa leaders around one table is an important step towards managing the #migration crisis
