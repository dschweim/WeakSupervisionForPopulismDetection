Press Release from Party: LibDem

Government emissions up despite recession says Hughes

Thu, 25 Mar 2010

No-one believes Labour will make the sustained emissions cuts we need when its taken a severe recession to cause real reductions," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary.

Commenting on provisional Government figures showing that public sector carbon emissions in 2009 were up on 2007 levels in spite of the recession, Simon Hughes said:

Its a travesty that while businesses and others are trying to pull their weight, Government and public sector emissions have actually increased in spite of the recession.

No-one believes Labour will make the sustained emissions cuts we need when its taken a severe recession to cause real reductions.

It is time to seriously invest in protecting our future. Only the Liberal Democrats have the bold plans we need to rebalance the economy and create green jobs, putting us on a path to a zero carbon Britain.
