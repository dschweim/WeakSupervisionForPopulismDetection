Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

REGIONAL POLICIES

In recent years, the United Kingdom has attracted five times as much Japanese investment as Germany or France, which powerfully demonstrates that we have created the most attractive environment in Europe for investors. Our positive policy towards inward investment will be maintained, in contrast to that of the TUC and the Labour Party.

The Government will continue to invest in a strong infrastructure, and boost technology expertise in the regions.

    We will ensure that regional policy is well targeted.
    We will continue to support all parts of the United Kingdom in their campaigns to attract inward investment.
    We will give additional emphasis to upgrading skills and technology when allocating funds.
