Labour's catastrophic failure on housing

Grant Shapps, the Shadow Minister for Housing, has commented on new figures published by the National Housing Federation.

"These figures reveal the catastrophic failure of Gordon Brown's house building-by-numbers policy", he said.

"The result is that fewer homes are being built now than during any peacetime period since 1924".

Shapps said the Housing Minister "has abandoned aspiration" because Labour had dropped its pledge of increasing home ownership, and Browns regional housing targets "have utterly failed".

"Its time to overhaul the planning system, reward house building with council tax match funding incentives and work with, rather than against local communities to get more done", he added.
