Press Release from Party: SNP

Salmond champions Scotland in Sky debate
Sun, 25/04/2010 - 12:18

Following the SKY Scottish debate this morning,
featuring
SNP leader and Scotlands First Minister Alex Salmond the SNPs Depute
leader
Nicola Sturgeon said it showed why Scotlands voice should be included
in the
UK debates so a real alternative to the Westminster parties can be
heard.

The debate , in which Alex Salmond highlighted the
need for
champions for Scotlands communities at Westminster to make sure
Scotlands views
are heard showed the  folly of excluding
the party of Government in Scotland from the UK wide debates.

 On fuel prices, on
the economy, trident, Iraq and London cuts Scotlands views are
different yet
they are not being heard.

SNP Depute Leader Nicola Sturgeon MSP said:

This debate showed what is missing from the UK
leaders
debates  a real alternative view and a different perspective to the
metropolitan
parties and metropolitan media.

Alex Salmond was the clear winner in this debate,
putting Scotlands
case in a statesmanlike manner while the opposition leaders squabbled
and
struggled.

The position put forward by Alex Salmond
demonstrates why
Scotland needs local and national  champions in Westminster
to make sure Scotlands
voice is heard on fuel prices, on London cuts, on Trident and the
Scottish
perspective on the war in Iraq and military conflicts.

"Only the SNP had a clear and workable policy on the
key Scottish issue of fuel prices.

Jim Murphy missed the mood in this debate.   He
struggled
to defend Labours record and had nothing to offer Scotlands
voters.  

While this debate was far livelier than the staid
and
static debates between the London leaders it is ridiculous that Scotland
 and Scottish voters are being deprived the
opportunity for Scotlands voice to be heard in full against the leaders
of the
London parties.
