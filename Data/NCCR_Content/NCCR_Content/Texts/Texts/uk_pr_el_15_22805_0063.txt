Challengers' Debate: Opening Speech

16 April 2015

 

There's been a powerful opposition in parliament in the past five years. Her name is Caroline Lucas.

Caroline is leading the way on restoring our NHS and our railways, fighting against fracking.

You can elect a strong group of Green MPs like Caroline, with a vision of a humane, sustainable Britain.

Don't believe the advocates of spiteful austerity.

This is the world's sixth richest country.

We can give our young a properly funded education.

We can look after our old with free health and social care.

We must make sure everyone has food on the table and a stable home to live in.

The Green Party are the real challengers – offering a million new jobs, combatting climate change, restoring vital community services.

That's why voters are turning to us. Challenge the establishment. Vote Green.
