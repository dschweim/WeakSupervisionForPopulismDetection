Description of the content:
--------------
While we will not oppose every measure in George Osborne's spending review, we will judge each decision on whether it is needed to abolish the deficit, whether it will help young people build a better life than their parents and whether it will help small businesses and entrepreneurs. What that mean…

Today is the Autumn Statement, I've written this for the Huffington Post about what I want to see in it: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tim-farron/spending-review_b_8642694.html

£250million of additional spending on mental health - to help ensure parity between mental and physical health, and support young people, who disproportionately suffer from mental health problems.

Stopping the Tax Credit cuts - which will hit millions of hard working low income families. While Labour has said they would accept some transitional protection, to help those worst affected, we don't believe this is not enough- we want to see the changes stopped entirely.

Investment in enterprise - we want to see guaranteed funding for innovative 'Catapult Centres', that help businesses develop their products, for at least five years.

A real commitment to investment in new infrastructure - with money allocated for new housing, ensuing everyone has access to high quality broadband and support renewable energy technology to help boost the renewables industry and combat climate change.

Proper analysis of the impact - The books shouldn't be balanced on the backs of the poor. In the first budget without the Liberal Democrats the Tories refused to set out who was made worse off by the choices they made. This time we need a real analysis.
