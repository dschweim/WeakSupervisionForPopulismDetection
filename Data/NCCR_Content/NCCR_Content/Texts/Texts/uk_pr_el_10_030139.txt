Press Release from Party: SNP

36m to tackle alcohol abuse
Mon, 26/04/2010 - 15:30

Michael
Matheson MSP has welcomed the announcement today by Health Secretary
Nicola Sturgeon of a 36 million investment in NHS treatments for
alcohol abuse.
       
The funding
from the Scottish Government will help local NHS boards maintain and
expand prevention, treatment and support services to tackle harmful
drinking habits.

SNP MSP Mr Matheson, a member of the Scottish Parliament's
Health Committee, said:
     
"The
development and expansion of NHS treatments and services to tackle
alcohol misuse is a key element of the SNP's radical package of measures
to address the harm that excessive drinking causes in Scotland. The new
funding announced today will allow local NHS boards to prioritise
preventive measures, such as brief interventions, which can help
individuals to recognise and address the impact that harmful drinking is
having on their health, and to take action before it is too late.

"We should never forget that, as well as the financial toll
that it takes on our health and criminal justice systems, alcohol abuse
exacts a terrible human cost for too many of our fellow Scots, as the
soaring alcohol-related death rates of recent years all too graphically
show. That's why the SNP is committed to making sure that quick and
effective early help is available for everyone who needs it.

"With its comprehensive strategy, combining major
investment in services and treatment with legislation to promote
responsible drinking and end alcohol being sold at pocket money prices,
this SNP government is taking the action that Scotland so badly needs to
prevent more Scots' lives being lost and communities blighted by
harmful drinking."
