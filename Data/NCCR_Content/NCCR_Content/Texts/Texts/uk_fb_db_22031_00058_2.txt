-------------
When the Liberal Democrats took the decision to step up to the plate and enter government in May 2010, Britains economy was on the brink.

Since then we have led an extraordinary success story.

We now have one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. 

If this parliament was about rescue, the next must be about renewal, about rewiring our economy so that it can flourish in the 21st century.

And as we do, we can raise our sights and begin to think big about what Britain can become. 

The Liberal Democrats believe that by building a strong, modern, open economy we can become the powerhouse of Europe.
