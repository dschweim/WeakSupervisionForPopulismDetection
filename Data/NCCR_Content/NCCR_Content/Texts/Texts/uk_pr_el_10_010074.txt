Labours social care plan barely worth paper its written on says Lamb

Tue, 30 Mar 2010

Were now being offered a series of piecemeal reforms that have not been properly thought through or costed," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on Labours plans to reform social care, Norman Lamb said:

After 13 years in power spent ducking social care reform we probably shouldnt be surprised that Labour has once again hit it into the long grass.

A white paper without any commitment to substantial change in the next Parliament is barely worth the paper it is written on.

Were now being offered a series of piecemeal reforms that have not been properly thought through or costed.

Seeking consensus is the right approach but that will only work if the cross-party commission is free to consider all ways of funding social care, not just Labours preferred policy. The commission should report within a year so changes can be implemented straight away.
