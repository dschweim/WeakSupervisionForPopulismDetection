Anti-terror laws should be reviewed says Huhne

Thu, 25 Mar 2010

We have lost too much liberty in the name of security in recent years," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on the Joint Committee on Human Rights report calling for all anti-terrorism laws introduced since 11 September 2001 to be reviewed, Chris Huhne said:

This report rightly says we need to review recent terror laws.

We have lost too much liberty in the name of security in recent years.
 
Control orders and extended pre-charge detention are a step too far.
