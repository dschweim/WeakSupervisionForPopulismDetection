-------------
This morning I was interviewed by Lorraine on ITV. We spoke about the appalling attacks in Paris. I explained that I want us to explore a political settlement that addresses the complexities of the conflict in Syria. As I said to Lorraine, "war doesn't necessarily bring about peace, it often can bring yet more conflict and more mayhem and more loss."
Watch the interview here.
