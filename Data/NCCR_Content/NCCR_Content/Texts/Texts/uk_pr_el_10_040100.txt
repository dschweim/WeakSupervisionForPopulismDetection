Climate Change Theory Takes another Hammering as Arctic Ices Grow in Size to Largest in Decade
April 5, 2010

arctic-ice-capsThe Climate Change or global warming theory, which predicted the destruction of the Arctic ice caps, has taken another hammering with the news that the ice floes are currently at their largest in a decade.

The increase in the ice packs has been caused by freezing winds blowing across the Bering Sea over the past few months.

This phenomenon, known as the Arctic Oscillation, is also partly responsible for the cold winter experienced in northern Europe and eastern America.

According to reports, the Arctic Oscillation usually acts like a ring of strong winds circulating anti-clockwise around the North Pole to dam up cold Arctic air.

Recently this ring has broken down, allowing blasts of cold air to escape to lower latitudes.

Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Colorado, expressed his surprise that the Arctic had recovered from the great melt of 2007 when summer ice shrank to its smallest recorded extent.

This caused climate change scientists, including those at the NSIDC, to issue warnings that global warming had pushed the Arctic to a tipping point from which it might not recover.

By the middle of 2009, however, the ice cap had expanded once again and this years figures show it approaching normal levels for the time of year.

In retrospect, the reactions to the 2007 melt were overstated. The lesson is that we must be more careful in not reading too much into one event, Mr Serreze was quoted as saying.

* Met Office figures for December to February suggest the UK had its coldest winter since 1979, with an average temperature of 1.6 degrees centigrade, fully 2.1 degrees below normal.
