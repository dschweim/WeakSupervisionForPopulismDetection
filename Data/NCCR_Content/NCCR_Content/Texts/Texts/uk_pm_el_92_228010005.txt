The Educational Balance Sheet

Positives

    In some ways educational standards are improving. The number of teachers in nursery and primary education grew from 176,228 in 1986 to 193,516 in 1991.
    Similarly, pupil-teacher ratios fell from 18.2 in 1980-81 to 16.9 in 1990-91.
    Some of the Government's changes have been for the better. The idea of Local Management of Schools has, in some places, produced school management of imagination and quality.

Negatives

    Overall, government funding of education is inadequate. The proportion of Britain's gross domestic product devoted to education fell from 5.6% in 1981-82 to 5.0% in 1990-91.
    The number of secondary school teachers fell from 224,618 in 1986 to 198,030 in 1991.
    There has been a serious decline in the number of people qualifying as teachers, down from 25,000 in 1980 to 18,500 in 1988. The Government is planning further cuts in teacher-training facilities.
    British children lose out in critical areas of education. The proportion of children in pre-compulsory education in 1987-1988 was a mere 3.6%, compared to 13.5% in Germany, 17.0% in Belgium and 18.4% in France.
    Compared to our competitors, not enough of our young people stay on to post-compulsory education. The proportion of 16-18 year olds in full-time education or training was 35% in Britain in 1988, compared to 47% in Germany, 66% in France and 79% in the USA.
    Investment in scientific research and development has fallen from 0.35% to 0.28% of GDP (while in Germany it stands at 0.40%), not only affecting our higher education system but creating a knock-on effect throughout the British economy.
