Press Release from Party: SNP

Championing Scottish business
Tue, 04/05/2010 - 16:22

Responding  to Tory leader David Cameron's announcement that he
plans to allow  Northern Ireland to slash its corporation tax rates, to
create an  enterprise zone in the Province, while simultaneously
planning special  cuts for Scotland, SNP leader and First Minister Alex
Salmond said:

"We support moves to help economic growth in Northern
Ireland - but  this is staggering hypocrisy from David Cameron and the
Tories.

"They  are determined to slash and burn Scotland's
budget by introducing a  special Cameron Cut that will be even more
savage than the cuts they  plan for the rest of the UK - but at the same
time they are promising a  boost to Northern Ireland through lower
corporation tax, a move they  reject for Scotland.

"The Tories are utterly two-faced on this issue, and are
reverting  to type in what is a typically anti-Scottish stance that will
kill off  the last remnants of their lingering support in Scotland.

"Perhaps  David Cameron is trying to make amends for suggesting that
Northern  Ireland is the first place he plans to 'pick' on if he is
given the  chance, by slashing their budget.

"There is no
doubt that that is what he has in mind for Scotland -  and only a vote
for SNP local and national champions can help protect  Scotland from the
savage cuts agenda of the Tories and the other London  parties."
