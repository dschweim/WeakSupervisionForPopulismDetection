EU Regulation Has Cost UK Economy 176 Billion since 1998
March 30, 2010

oe-out-of-controlThe implementation and regulation of European Union laws has cost the British taxpayer 176 billion since 1998, roughly equivalent to the countrys entire budget deficit, according to a new report by think tank Open Europe.

According to the report, the annual cost of EU regulation in 2009 stands at 32.8 billion. For this amount, Open Europe said, the British government could cut corporation tax by two thirds.

Since Britain launched its Regulatory Reform Agenda in 2005, the annual cost of regulation has doubled (up from 16.5 billion). Some 59 percent of the cost arising from regulation in 2009 stemmed from EU legislation.

Open Europe said it estimated that the benefit/cost ratio of the regulations they studied was 1.58  in other words, for every 1 of cost introduced by a regulation since 1998, it has delivered 1.58 of benefits.

However, the benefit/cost ratio of EU regulations is 1.02, while the ratio of UK regulations is 2.35, the report said.

This means that UK-sourced regulations deliver a benefit almost 2.5 times higher on average than regulations coming from the EU. For every 1 of cost, EU regulations introduced since 1998 have only delivered 1.02 of benefits. Expressed differently, it is 2.5 times more cost effective to regulate nationally than it is to regulate via the EU. This also means that EU regulations come dangerously close to failing an overall cost-benefit analysis.

The report went on to point out that EU employment legislation introduced since 1998 has cost the UK economy 38.9 billion. This means that 22 percent of the overall cost of regulations introduced in that period in the UK can be sourced to EU employment laws alone, Open Europe said.

In addition, the report revealed, 30 percent of businesses state that it has become more difficult to comply with regulation in the last 12 months.

The think tank, usually thought to be sympathetic towards the Tories, pointed out another truth: The Conservatives have chosen to focus their regulatory reform agenda almost exclusively at the domestic level.

This, in turn, could lead to contradictory or undeliverable policies since a potential future Conservative government will only on average have full control over 28 percent of annual the cost of regulation, the report said.

In other words, reform at EU level is what is needed, not tinkering with UK regulation. The Conservatives have already fully committed themselves to the Lisbon Treaty and the new EU constitutional arrangement. Hence, Open Europes appeal to that party is likely to fall on deaf ears.
