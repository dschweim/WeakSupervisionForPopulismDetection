Press Release from Party: LibDem

Unemployment increase underlines fragility of UK economy says Cable

Wed, 21 Apr 2010

"We will ensure that the nationalised banks lend money to sound British businesses to help support the recovery" said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the ONS figures which show that the number of people   unemployed in the UK rose by 43,000 to 2.5m during the three months to February, Vince Cable said:

Labours record speaks for itself as unemployment is now higher than when they came into office. 
 
It underlines just how fragile the UK economy is and exposes the folly of Tory plans to pull the rug from under the recovery.
 
Without a strong and concerted plan of action to support jobs and businesses, the fallout from the recession will be with us for years to come.
 
The Liberal Democrats have that plan. We will ensure that the nationalised banks lend money to sound British businesses to help support the recovery. We have a jobs package that will help people back into work and improve the countrys infrastructure.
