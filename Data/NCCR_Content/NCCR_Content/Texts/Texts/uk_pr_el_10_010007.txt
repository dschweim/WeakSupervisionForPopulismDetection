 Liberal Democrats call for fair start for children

Sat, 13 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrat Spring Conference today backed radical plans to change the education system to give children a fair start in life.

The proposals include:

    An extra 2.5bn investment in schools to reduce class sizes, improve discipline and provide more one-to-one tuition to help struggling pupils, paid as a pupil premium to schools for each of the poorest 1m children they teach
    The scrapping of tuition fees for first undergraduate degrees, whether studied full or part-time, over six years

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Shadow Children, Schools and Families Secretary, David Laws said:

It is a disgrace that where children are born and how much their parents earn can still dictate how well they do at school.

Schools should be a level playing field, opening up opportunities and making sure that all children have a fair chance to achieve their potential.

Our plans to invest an extra 2.5bn in schools will enable headteachers to cut class sizes and provide children who are struggling with the support they need.  We will set schools free from constant Government interference so they can focus on getting the best from all children.

I am proud that the Liberal Democrats have made such a clear and bold commitment to give every child a fair start in life.
