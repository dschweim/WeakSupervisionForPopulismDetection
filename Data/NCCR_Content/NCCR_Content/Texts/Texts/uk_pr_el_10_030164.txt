Press Release from Party: SNP

London leaders hiding on cuts
Fri, 30/04/2010 - 09:50

Speaking after the BBC election debate on the economy, Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said:

Rather than genuine debate, this was more a turgid conspiracy of silence on the big issues of the election, because the three London-based parties all agree on the 250 billion Westminster cuts agenda  cutting tougher and deeper than even Margaret Thatcher.

This was the Iceberg Debate  which tried to hide the vast cuts to public services planned by the Tories, Labour and LibDems.

SNP local and national champions offer an alternative for Scotland, and hope for the future  protecting our vital public services; cutting the things we neither need nor want such as Trident nuclear weapons, ID cards, and nuclear dumps; and boosting Scotlands economy with the powers of independence.
