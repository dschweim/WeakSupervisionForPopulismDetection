Press Release from Party: UKIP

Labour all at sea over immigration

Wednesday, 5th May 2010

Gordon Brown once again displays he hasn't a clue  and Labours open-door immigration policy put under fresh scrutiny  with the revelation that his frequently-quoted EU net immigration figures bear no relation to reality.

The Labour Prime Minister is fond of telling the public that as many Britons have gone to work in the EU as EU citizens have come to work here  approximately one million each way. But figures released by Eurostat, the European Unions own statistics agency, show that just 267,800 British workers are plying their trade in other EU member states.

UKIPs chief spokesman, Nigel Farage, said yesterday: These figures destroy the argument that we have a mutually beneficial open door with the EU.

Additional figures show that approximately half of the 1,020,000 European migrants now working in Britain have come from Poland and other Eastern European countries.

The numbers make a mockery of Gordon Browns British jobs for British workers promise, made as he came to power  without being elected  in June 2007.

UKIPs policies on immigration and jobs have been carefully formulated to ensure that British jobs do go to British workers. The Party promises to freeze immigration for five years, ensure only highly skilled workers are allowed to settle in the UK after that period, and create five nationwide manufacturing programmes to add one million jobs to the economy.
