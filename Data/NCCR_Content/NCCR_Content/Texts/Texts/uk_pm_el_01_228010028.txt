Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Aviation

Travel by air is growing, raising environmental and safety issues. We will:

    Reject privatisation of National Air Traffic Services creating instead a not-for-profit, public body to protect safety in the air.

    Work to reform aviation fuel taxation. We will work at the European level to ensure that the whole system of aviation fuel taxation is reformed internationally, as part of a longer-term strategy for reducing energy use and pollution through cleaner fuels and more efficient aircraft. We will also press the EU Commission to allow removal of remaining air passenger duty on flights to peripheral and less accessible parts of the UK which rely on air transport.

    Restrict noisy night flights and airport expansion. We will ensure that restrictions are imposed on the expansion of night flights where these will have a negative impact upon residential areas. In addition, we will ensure that there are clear rules governing future expansion of airports, strengthening consideration of environmental impacts and safety implications.

Setting You Free

    Cut restrictions on local government which prevent councils from raising funds to improve public transport and the environment.
