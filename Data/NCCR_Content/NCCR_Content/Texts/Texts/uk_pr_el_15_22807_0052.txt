Mr Farage's online support has risen substantially since the last TV debates, after which he was judged to be the joint winner alongside Nicola Sturgeon, or David Cameron, depending on which polls you believe.

Now he has overtaken former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who rose to second place following the Scottish referendum. Mr Farage currently has over 162,400 followers, an increase of 10 percent in the last week.

He is followed by Salmond on 162,100, then Nicola Sturgeon on 152,700. In fifth is Ed Miliband on 87,800, with Nick Clegg in sixth on 85,300. The Green Party leader Natalie Bennett is on just 14,800.

A spokesman for Mr Farage said, "We have seen UKIP's appeal amongst young people double in the last 5 years, and recently we have seen massive online growth too. People who have never before been engaged or involved in politics are backing Nigel Farage and backing UKIP. We think it's because they realise only one party is committed to changing this country for the better, and that's us."
