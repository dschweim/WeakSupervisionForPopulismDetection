Party Manifesto: Lab (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

Securing Britain’s future
The plans set out in this Manifesto take full account of the fiscal position we face. We will protectfrontline public services while meeting our commitment to halve the deficit over the next four years.We are now emerging from the global financial crisis. It has had a lasting effect on tax receipts, herein the UK and across the world. We are sticking to our spending plans this year so that support forfamilies and businesses remains as we secure the recovery. But from 2011-12, as growth takes hold,spending will be tighter.The Manifesto reflects the tough choices that we will make to secure Britain’s future in a way that isfair to all:Tough choices for £15 billion efficiency • savings in 2010-11.• Tough choices on cutting government overheads: £11 billion of further operationalefficiencies and other cross-cutting savings to streamline government will be deliveredby 2012-13.• Tough choices on pay: action to control public-sector pay including a one per centcap on basic pay uplifts for 2011-12 and 2012-13, saving £3.4 billion a year, and newrestrictions on senior pay-setting. Tough decisions on public sector pensions to cap thetaxpayers’ liability – saving £1 billion a year.• Tough choices on spending: £5 billion already identified in cuts to lower priorityspending.• Tough choices on welfare: our reforms will increase fairness and work incentives,including £1.5 billion of savings being delivered.• Tough choices on assets: £20 billion of asset sales by 2020.• Tough choices on tax: a bonus tax, reduced tax relief on pensions for the best off,a new 50p tax rate on earnings over £150,000 and one penny on National Insurance Contributions.
