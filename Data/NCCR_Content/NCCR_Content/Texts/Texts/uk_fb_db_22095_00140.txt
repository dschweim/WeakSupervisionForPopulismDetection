A girl in Toronto just shared a powerful story from today. She was in class at University and started reading my book - Consumed By Love before class started. A girl she sits next to who she's been praying for to become a Christian and longing to reach for a long time says to her, "I want to read that book!" She says, "It's a Christian book." I don't care!" her friend replies. "It's about Jesus," She says. The girl replies "There's something about that book! I HAVE to read it!" She handed her the book and the girl was so grateful. Now the first girl is buying a second copy! :) 
What an awesome testimony and answer to one of my deepest hearts desires concerning my book - that the lost will be found & come to Christ through the book!
