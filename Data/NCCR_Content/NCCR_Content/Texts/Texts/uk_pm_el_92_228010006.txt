The Social Balance Sheet

Positives

    Overall, British standards of health are improving. Life expectancy for men rose from 70.8 years in 1981 to 73.2 years in 1991, and for women from 76.8 to 78.8 years.
    Home ownership in Britain rose from 55.8% of households in 1981 to 67.3% in 1991.
    The size of the police establishment has increased by 15% since 1978-79. Expenditure on the policy rose by 55% in real terms over the same period, and policy pay showed a 29% real rise.

    While the NHS hospital sector's purchasing power grew by 15.6% between 1980-81 and 1990-91, expenditure requirements (due to demographic change and the rising cost of medical technology) in fact increased by 21.3%.
    The total number of people waiting for NHS treatment in the UK rose to more than one million in March 1990, 25% of inpatients wait for longer than a year for treatment.
    The number of sign tests has fallen by 21% since the introduction of charges in 1988.
    The Government has withdrawn funding for new house building, and refused to allow councils to spend the receipts they have gained from new home owners. As a result, the amount of local authority housing built has fallen from more than 65,300 homes in 1979 to a mere 8,600 in 1990.
    The number of people accepted by local authorities as homeless rose from 70,000 in 1979 to almost 170,000 in 1990 - and this does not include the single homeless.
    With the massive expansion of mortgage lending and the subsequent use of interest rates to bring down inflation, the number of mortgages over 12 months in arrears rose from 59,690 in June 1991 to 91,740 by the end of the year. The number of properties repossessed rose by 74% over the 1990 figure to 75,540 in 1991.
    Outcomes have failed disastrously to match the input of additional resources to law and order. Recorded rate of notified crime have increased year on year by 5.5% on average, and by a massive 16% in 1990-91.
    At the same time, crime clear-up rates have declined by 32%.
    Britain has proportionately the largest prison population of any Community country - and we also have more prisoners serving life sentences than the rest of the EC combined.
