April 4, 2010

Dozens of immigration raids by the UK Border Agency take place every week up and down the country as a new poll shows that 84 percent of voters think mass immigration is bad for Britain.

According to the poll, conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion for a daily newspaper, just four percent of Britons think current immigration policies have been a success.

The poll also showed that immigration is the top issue for 20 percent of voters. Only the recession ranked higher in peoples concerns.

Some 42 percent said the Governments policies on immigration have been generally a failure and 33 percent believe they were more of a failure than a success.

While 84 percent regard unlimited immigration as bad for Britain, 38 percent of voters said they did not know which party would be best at bringing immigration under control.

Public concern over the immigration invasion  which has reached colonisation proportions  is highlighted by the fact that the UK Border Agency has been stretched to the limit and carries out dozens of immigration raids every week.

In Merseyside alone, there are five raids every week in the ongoing hunt for illegal immigrants.

According to reports, officers from the UK Border Agency visit suspected locations at businesses and homes in the country almost every day of the week.

The figures were revealed after Liverpools Tai Pan restaurant, and adjoining supermarket, was targeted two weeks ago. Nineteen people  a mixture of Chinese, Malaysians and a Pakistani, were detained at the premises on Blackstone Street.
