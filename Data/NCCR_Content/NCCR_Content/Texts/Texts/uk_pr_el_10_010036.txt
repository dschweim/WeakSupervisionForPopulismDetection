Labours dementia strategy is failing says Lamb

Thu, 18 Mar 2010

Dementia has a crippling effect on families across the country and this problem is only going to get bigger as people continue to live longer," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on the findings of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementias inquiry into the funding of the National Dementia Strategy (NDS) released today, Norman Lamb said:
 
This report makes for depressing reading and reveals that Labours dementia strategy is failing.
 
We urgently need to improve services for people suffering with dementia and make sure that funding is available to provide carers with valuable time off.
 
Dementia has a crippling effect on families across the country and this problem is only going to get bigger as people continue to live longer.
 
If we want to ensure this money gets to the people who need it we must give local people the power to hold their local health service to account.
