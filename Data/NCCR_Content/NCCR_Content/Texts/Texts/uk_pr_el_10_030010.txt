Press Release from Party: SNP


Airmiles Mandelson costs taxpayer 3.4m
Tue, 16/03/2010 - 14:09
SNP MP and Treasury Spokesperson Stewart Hosie MP has hit out at the Business Secretary, Lord Mandelson, after it emerged the Department of Business, Enterprise and Skills had spent an astonishing 3.4m on international travel in 2009 alone.
Peter Mandelson was made a life peer by Prime Minister Gordon Brown in October 2008 so that he could rejoin the UK Labour Government despite  not being elected. Last summer, Peter Mandelson said the UK faced 10 years  of austerity  but appears to have been racking up the airmiles ever since.
In a written answer, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Skills (formerly the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) reveals that it has spent almost 10 million on international travel in the last three years.
Commenting, Mr Hosie said:
Everyone knows Peter Mandelson wanted to be Foreign Secretary, and from the look of his travel budget you would think he got the job. The  Business Secretary has more airmiles than Judith Chalmers and people will wonder whether his department's spending on travel is totally essential and represents good value for money.
At a time when people are tightening their belts as a result of 
Labour's recession, UK Ministers really need to show some restraint in how they are spending taxpayers money. Of course business interests must be  represented abroad but, in these tough times, we need to know that money is being spent wisely.
It is absurd that the UK Government is allowing such largesse in travel budgets whilst inflicting damaging cuts on Scotlands budget for frontline services.
The text of Mr Hosies question is below:
Stewart Hosie: To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills what expenditure his Department has incurred on international travel since 2007. 
Mr. McFadden: The expenditure incurred on international travel by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills since 2007 is:
2007: 2,768,317
2008: 3,634,638
2009: 3,493,441
