Text of the posting:
-------------
An almost final tally of Green councillors (still counting in Middlesborough)

COUNCILLORS: 167
COUNCILS: 59

LARGEST GROUPS
Norwich City - 14
Bristol City - 13
Brighton and Hove - 11
Lancaster - 9 
Stroud D.C. - 7
Oxford City - 6

Should also add a big breakthrough (not in my previous tally) - three councillors on Lewes District Council, where previously there were none.
