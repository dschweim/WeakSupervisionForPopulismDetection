Press Release from Party: SNP

FM announces over 4,000 new college places
Sat, 20/03/2010 - 16:52

An extra 4,100 new college places will be created in the
most deprived areas of Scotland next year through a 15.3 million cash
injection, First Minister Alex Salmond announced today.

European Structural Funding of 6.9 million is being match funded by
8.4 million from the Scottish Funding Council to target the pressures
on colleges in the most socially deprived areas where demand for places
has increased during the economic downturn.

The Scottish Government is already providing the college sector with a
cash increase of 44.8 million in 2010-11 compared to the 2009-10
budget, despite the current economic climate.

First Minister Alex Salmond said:

Our commitment to supporting further and higher education in Scotland
has been made absolutely clear by the real terms increase in this
years Budget despite 500 million cuts from Westminster.

Colleges are playing a vital role in helping the Scottish Government ensure a strong economic recovery for Scotland.

These new places will provide more than 4,000 people with a real
opportunity to train, learn and develop their skills so they are work
ready and well equipped to find long-term employment despite the
current economic climate.

We are already investing 1.77 billion in our colleges and
universities in the highest budget since devolution, and these extra
places underline our continued commitment to put further education at
the heart of our plans to build the economy.

ENDS

Notes:

The funding package of 15.3 million comprises 6.9 million in European
Structural Funds, plus 8.4 million which is being drawn from the
Barnett consequentials announced in June 2009.

These Barnett consequentials amount to 28.1 million, spread over two
years, and are being applied in their entirety to colleges and
students.  Of that sum, 19.7 million was provided to the college
sector in 2009-10, with the remaining 8.4 million being used in
2010-11 to match fund the resources which have been secured from
European Structural Funds.
