Party Manifesto: LibDem (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

our first priorities:4 steps to a fairer Britain

fair taxesthat put money back in your pocket• The first £10,000 you earn tax-free: a tax cut of £700 formost people• 3.6 million low earners and pensioners freed from incometax completely• Paid for in full by closing loopholes that unfairly benefitthe wealthy and polluters

a fair futurecreating jobs by making Britain greener• Break up the banks and get them lending again to protectreal businesses• Honesty about the tough choices needed to cut the deficit• Green growth and jobs that last by investing in infrastructure

a fair chancefor every child• Ensure children get the individual attention they need bycutting class sizes• Made possible by investing £2.5 billion in schools targetedto help struggling pupils• Give schools the freedom to make the right choices fortheir pupils

a fair dealby cleaning up politics• Put trust back into politics by giving you the right to sackcorrupt MPs• Restore and protect hard-won British civil liberties with aFreedom Bill• Overhaul Westminster completely: fair votes, an electedHouse of Lords, all politicians to pay full British taxes
