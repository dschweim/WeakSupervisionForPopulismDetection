News story

Dominic Grieve, the Shadow Justice Secretary, has reacted to the latest figures on prison releases published by the Ministry of Justice.

The number of prisoners released early on End of Custody Licence has now reached 80,541.

"As Chancellor, Gordon Brown refused successive Home Secretaries the funding they needed to provide adequate prison capacity", Grieve said. "As Prime Minister, he released 80,000 prisoners early. Labour simply have no credibility when they talk about criminal justice".

According to Ministry of Justice data, offenders on early release have committed 1,602 alleged further offences, including three murders. With the scheme being wound down ahead of the General Election from 9 March 2010, this is the last full month of the schemes operation.

"We campaigned relentlessly for this reckless scheme to be scrapped and if elected we will provide the new prison capacity we need to ensure it is not reintroduced", Grieve added.
