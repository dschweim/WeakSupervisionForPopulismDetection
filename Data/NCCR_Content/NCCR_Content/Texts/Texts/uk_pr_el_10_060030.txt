Sugar appointment criticised
Thursday, April 1 2010
Philip Hammond

Philip Hammond has criticised Labour's announcement that Lord Alan Sugar will lead a new government taskforce designed to fight the corner of small businesses against the banks.

"Only Labour could announce on April Fools day that it had appointed the man who called credit-starved small businesses moaners who lived in Disney World to be the adjudicator on their applications for bank loans", he said.

Lord Mandelson has selected Lord Sugar to sit on the taskforce which will set up the Small Business Credit Adjudicator. Lord Mandelson believes the people he has chosen "... understand the critical importance of new finance and credit flow to the growth of small, innovative companies".

But Lord Sugar said last year: "The moaners are bust... they dont need the bank, they need an insolvency practitioner".

This comes on the same day that the Federation of Small Businesses, the British Retail Consortium and 23 business leaders attacked Labours planned tax on jobs.

"No wonder no-one believes Lord Mandelsons claims to be the champion of small business when Labour would rather tax jobs and the recovery than cut government waste", Hammond added.
