Disgusting Liar David Cameron: I Needed 680 from Taxpayers to Heat My 750,000 House
April 27, 2010

David Cameron's 750,000 house -- he says he could not heat it unless the wisteria was removed at taxpayers' expense.

Millionaire Conservative Party leader David Cameron has told BBC Radio 1 that he needed 680 of taxpayers money to remove wisteria from his private homes chimney  so that he could heat the house.

The preposterous claim that Mr Cameron heats his 750,000 house with a single fire is a gross insult to the voters intelligence and the taxpayers of this country.

Mr Cameron said that he had claimed 680 for repairs which were necessary because he couldnt actually heat the house.

His claim for repairs, which was made in 2006 and included clearing vines from his home in Oxfordshire, was a basic maintenance bill, he said.

I think what I did was perfectly appropriate because I had a second home  and MPs have to live in two places  and theres a system of expenses to enable that, he said.

I paid back one very important claim, which was a claim for household maintenance which included the famous wisteria on the house because, of course, the chimney didnt work so I couldnt actually heat the house, Mr Cameron lied.

The size of Mr Camerons house makes it laughably untrue to claim that a blocked chimney prevented him from heating the manor which has at least 20 different rooms  all of which have central heating.

To add insult to injury, Mr Cameron also charges his mortgage costs to the taxpayers at a price of 21,293.86 every year  over and above his parliamentary salary.

In addition, Mr Cameron has a home in Notting Hill, West London and a second in Dean, Oxfordshire. There is no mortgage on his house in London, which is said to be worth 2 million.

Mr Cameron is however in good company with his web of lies and deceit over expenses.

Other Conservative MPs who have been caught with their fingers in the till include:

- Peter Ainsworth, who tried to charge nearly 1,000 for a pewter finish radiator cover on his expenses;

- Michael Ancram, who put the cost of having his swimming pool boiler serviced on his parliamentary allowances.

- Sir Paul Beresford, who works up to three days a week as a dentist, designated his west London property, which includes his surgery, as his second home on his parliamentary allowances.

- Crispin Blunt, who was told to stop claiming Commons allowance on his home because his children live there.

- Peter Bone, who claims 1,300 a month rent on a flat in London, along with 400 a month for food. His other claims included 299.99 on a television, 87.98 on a DVD player and 599.98 on two sofas.

- Simon Burns, who claimed 1,000 to rent a flat in west London, despite having an Essex constituency 35 minutes away from central London by train. He also claimed 865 for a new bed and mattress.

- Douglas Carswell, who claimed 655 from his expenses for a love seat.

- Bill Cash, who claimed more than 15,000 in taxpayer-funded expenses to pay his daughter rent for her west London flat  even though he owned a home closer to Westminster.
