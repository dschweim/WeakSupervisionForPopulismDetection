Press Release from Party: SNP

Labour cuts 'tougher' than Thatcher
Thu, 25/03/2010 - 20:02
Chancellor Alistair Darling has admitted that Labour are planning spending cuts "tougher and deeper" than those implemented by the Conservatives in the 1980s. 
SNP Treasury Spokesman, Stewart Hosie MP, said admission drove a coach and horses through the untruthful claims made by Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray and his MSPs in the Scottish Parliament today.
Analysis of the Budget already shows that Westminster cuts will be nearly three as much of those for the UK as a whole. The Scottish budget will be cut in real terms in 2010/11 by 1.3% compared to only 0.5% UK-wide.
Mr Hosie said:
"This admission by Alistair Darling destroys any claims Labour have made that they will protect Scottish spending. The SNPs campaign of More Nats, Less Cuts has become all the more relevant in the coming election.
"We now have the proof that shows why Labour are just like the Tories in Scotland.
"Labour and the Tories are the tweedledum and tweedledee of UK politics.
"The people of Scotland have a clear choice at this coming election  SNP or Labour. A Labour party cutting Scottish public spending and threatening the creation of jobs, or a vote for a party that stands up for Scotland and against Labours Thatcher-style cuts.

Asked by the BBC's Political Editor Nick Robinson to accept the Treasury's own figures suggest deeper, tougher cuts than those implemented by the Thatcher government in the 1980s, Mr Darling replied:
"They will be deeper and tougher - where we make the precise comparison I think is secondary to fact is an acknowledgement that these reductions will be tough".
