Press Release from Party: SNP

Tackling poverty & income inequality
Fri, 30/04/2010 - 09:18

The SNP has exposed Scottish Labour's hypocrisy on low pay,
following a debate on a Green Party motion in the Scottish Parliament
today.  

Rob Gibson, SNP MSP for Highland and Islands, who spoke in the
debate, said:  

"In Parliament today, Labour tried their usual
smoke and mirrors attempt to distract from their own culpability on the
issue of poverty pay.  

"As they well know, the Scottish Government has no locus on private
sector pay, which is reserved to Westminster - and which the
Labour/Tory/Lib Dem Calman Commission would not devolve to Scotland.

"The
SNP government has taken significant steps to improve public sector pay
levels within the powers available to it, but without control over both
private sector pay and the tax and benefits system, any Scottish
administration is powerless to raise the take-home pay of the lowest
paid workers, such as the majority of those in the hotel and restaurant
sector.  

"The SNP has commended the efforts of, for example, Glasgow City
Council to set a minimum living wage of 7 an hour for its staff, but
the fact that they have had to do so exposes the inadequacy of the
minimum wage set by Labour at Westminster. Had Labour index-linked the
minimum wage to earnings from the beginning, the rate would not have
fallen so far behind the level that can be decently described as a
living wage today.  

"The SNP is fully committed to tackling poverty and income
inequality and to making work pay. If Labour in Scotland are genuinely
committed to the same, they should join with the SNP in demanding that
the levers of power to address poverty pay are devolved to the Scottish
government as soon as possible. Until they do, they will continue to let
Scotland's lowest paid workers down."
