Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001

Pensions, Wages and Benefits

Freedom from poverty

Poverty restricts freedom because people without a decent income do not have the opportunities enjoyed by others. More needs to be done for pensioners and those with low incomes to ensure that all in Britain have a better quality of life.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Boost the basic state pension, particularly for the over-75s

    Support disabled people by extending winter fuel allowance payments to the severely disabled

    Help the lower paid by aiming to reduce taxation for poorer taxpayers

    Protect workers on low incomes by reviewing the minimum wage annually

    Tackle child poverty with extra money for families on long-term income support

It is a great indictment of the Governments of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair that all of them allowed the gap between rich and poor people in Britain to become wider than before. The Blair Government has taken a disappointingly mean-spirited approach towards pensioners and lone parents in particular.

We recognise that there are many theatres in the war against poverty. Our success in tackling poverty in Britain would be measured by a Quality of Life Index. This would include a statement of the standards which a citizen of the UK might reasonably expect to enjoy in order to participate fully in society and have a decent quality of life.
