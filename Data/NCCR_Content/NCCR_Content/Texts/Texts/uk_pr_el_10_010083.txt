Press Release from Party: LibDem

Sugar appointment is a silly stunt says Cable

Thu, 01 Apr 2010

With this appointment, the Government is showing the same contempt for small business people as Lord Sugar shows them when they complain about the banks," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the news that Lord Sugar is heading up a new task force to help small firms turned down for loans, Vince Cable said:

With this appointment, the Government is showing the same contempt for small business people as Lord Sugar shows them when they complain about the banks.

Instead of this silly stunt, the Government should be making the banks lend business what they promised to last year.
 
They must take a firm hand with the banks which we own to ensure that they are lending to British businesses and supporting our economy.

Unless businesses can get the credit they need to create jobs and growth, there will be no recovery.
