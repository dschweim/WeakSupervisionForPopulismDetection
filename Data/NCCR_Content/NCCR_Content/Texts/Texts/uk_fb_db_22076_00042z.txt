-------------
I'm holding my annual football youth surgeries tomorrow. I think it is very important to engage with the young people in our area and the summer holidays gives me the perfect chance to discuss the issues affecting them. It's also great for me to get the occasional game of five-a-side in!

I will be at the MUGAs on Hallgarth from 11am to 12pm, Sandylands from 1pm to 2pm and Kirkbarrow from 3pm to 4pm. So if you have an issue or want a chat...or even want a kick about...I will see you there! http://m.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/13638980.Farron_s_football_surgeries_announced_for_young_people_to_engage_in_politics/
