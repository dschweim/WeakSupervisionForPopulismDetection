Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labours free-care plans are a flimsy fantasy says Lamb

Tue, 30 Mar 2010

By failing to spell out how these policies will be paid for in the future, its hardly surprising that people will worry there are significant cuts in other services to come," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on the Channel 4 news report that revealed the Government is planning to cut the Attendance Allowance budget by 100m to pay for free residential care, Norman Lamb, said:
 
Labour promised to protect disability benefits from any future cuts but it looks like theyre going to have to raid budgets to pay for their free care plans.
 
The flimsiness of the plans put forward today beggars belief and all we learned is that there is an enormous funding black hole in the Governments plans to reform social care.
 
By failing to spell out how these policies will be paid for in the future, its hardly surprising that people will worry there are significant cuts in other services to come.
 
Instead of dreaming up fantasy proposals to desperately try and appeal to the electorate, we should be sitting down together across parties and working out how we can create an affordable social care system for the future.
