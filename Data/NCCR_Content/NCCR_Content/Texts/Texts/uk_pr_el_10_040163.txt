Press Release from Party: BNP


Protect British Industry to Save Jobs, Nick Griffin Tells BBC
April 21, 2010

British National Party leader Nick Griffin has called for restrictions on imports from China to protect British jobs, and has said that liberal economic policies pursued by successive Tory and Labour regimes have utterly bankrupted Britain.

Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4, Mr Griffin said that such restrictions would not hurt the British economy as trade with China was a one-way street.

Action is needed to protect UK manufacturing from unfair foreign competition, particularly in the countrys remaining industrial heartlands, he continued.

We dont believe British workers can compete with Chinese workers who are working for a fraction of our wages.

We have got eight million adults of working age not working in Britain and if we protect certain sections of our industry to create jobs we would get these people off the dole.

Mr Griffin said Japan and other countries in Asia had followed such a course and had created new industries as a result.

He said his party was not isolationist but believed the liberal economic policy pursued by successive governments had utterly bankrupted the country.

He added: The alternative is to give up on industry because everything would go to China. It would be a disaster.
