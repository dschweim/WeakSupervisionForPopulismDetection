Menzies Campbell launches review of UK nuclear weapons

Sat, 03 Apr 2010

Menzies Campbell has today launched his review of options for the future of Britain's nuclear weapons policy.

Welcoming the review, Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg said:

"After wide consultation with security policy experts, Menzies Campbell has produced a thoroughgoing analysis which clearly demonstrates that there are credible alternatives to the like-for-like replacement of Trident.

"This report destroys the myth perpetuated by Labour and the Conservatives that Britain has to choose between full-scale Trident or unilateralism.

"Excluding Trident from the defence review is both absurd and irresponsible."
