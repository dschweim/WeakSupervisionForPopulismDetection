Press Release from Party: Con

News story
Our contract for young people
Monday, May 3 2010
David Cameron

David Cameron has launched the Conservative Party's contract for young people.

"We are publishing our contract for young people", he said, "because they are our best resource in this country, so often done down and demonised by the media or by politicians or a combination of both".

"They are our future. And today I want to set out the things that we want to do to invest in our young people and to give them hope and opportunity for the future".

Speaking in Blackpool, Cameron went on to highlight the key Conservative policies that will do just that, such as the Conservative pledge to give "the opportunity for every 16 year-old to take part in National Citizen Service".

He also pledged to bring in "more competitive sport in our schools", helped by establishing a "School Olympics". And he spoke of the importance of "really good mentoring programmes in the poorest parts of our country".
