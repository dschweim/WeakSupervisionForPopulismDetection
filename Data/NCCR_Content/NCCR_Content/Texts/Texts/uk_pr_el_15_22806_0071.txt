Making sure hard work is always rewarded
Post date: 14/04/2015

The next Conservative Government will pass a new law to guarantee a Tax-Free Minimum Wage.

Labour burdened hardworking people with too much tax, and Britain’s lowest paid workers were amongst the hardest hit by Labour’s Great Recession. In contrast, we can proudly say that the modern, compassionate Conservative Party is the party of working people; for millions of workers not just the party of low tax – the party of no tax.

As the Prime Minister said in his party conference speech last year: ‘with us, if you work 30 hours a week on minimum wage, you will pay no income tax at all. Nothing. Zero. Zilch’.
