Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Transport

Reliable and safe transport

A decent transport system is fundamental to an equitable and environmentally sustainable society. We will work to build an integrated transport system throughout the country that is safe, reliable and affordable. Our policies place special emphasis on reducing problems from pollution and congestion.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Provide free off-peak local travel on buses for pensioners and disabled people, and aim for half-price travel at all times for under-19s in full time education

    Abolish car tax for those who drive less-polluting vehicles

    Establish stronger public control over the railways

While progress in other public services in Britain has been disappointingly slow over the past four years, in transport the country has clearly gone backwards. Roads are more congested. Buses are less reliable. Railways are in chaos.

Privatisation of the railways by the Conservatives has been a disaster. Regulation is too lax. Companies do not have the right incentives for long-term investment. The system is fragmented. It is all too easy, when things go wrong, for one firm to pass the buck to another. Safety can be compromised.

Labour has failed to win the case for increased investment in public transport. When the price of petrol went up and revenues from petrol tax consequently soared, the Labour Government should have earmarked the extra revenue specifically for improving public transport. It failed to do so.
