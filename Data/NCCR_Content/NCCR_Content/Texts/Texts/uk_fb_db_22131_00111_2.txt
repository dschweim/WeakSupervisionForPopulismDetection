Very much enjoyed meeting with the good folk of Marple, Greater Manchester, with our brilliant candidate William Wragg.

The North West is going gangbusters and if we want to continue creating jobs, investing in our infrastructure and handing more powers to the great cities of our country like Manchester, then we have got to stick with our long term economic plan and elect people like William.
