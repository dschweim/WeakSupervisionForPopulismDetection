News story
Labour secretly planning to cut front line immigration officials

Conservatives can today reveal that Gordon Brown has asked for voluntary redundancies from front line immigration officers working for the UK Borders Agency.

These cuts come in the wake of Gordon Brown being rebuked by the UK Statistics Authority over dodgy use of immigration statistics.

"Hardly a day seems to go by without yet another example of Gordon Brown being dishonest with voters", said Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling.

Officials for UKBA are at the front line in controlling our borders from illegal immigration. Management at the UKBA have been criticised for the amount of money spent on bonuses and PR.

It may come as a surprise to staff that cuts are not being made elsewhere in the agency. The terms offered in the email asking for voluntary redundancy are the reduced terms that the PCS have been striking about.

Only last week, Gordon Brown made a speech on immigration in a bid to respond to public concern over the issue.

Grayling criticised Brown for accusing the Conservatives of risking the recovery with plans for early action to reduce the deficit - and trying to talk tough on immigration - whilst "privately preparing to sack immigration officers to save money himself".

"It's blatant hypocrisy by our Prime Minister and just underlines why Britain desperately needs change", he added.
