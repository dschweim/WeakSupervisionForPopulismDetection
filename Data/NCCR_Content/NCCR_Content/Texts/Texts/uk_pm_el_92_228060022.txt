CONSUMER AFFAIRS

Consumers want choice, quality and value for money Competition only works effectively if consumers have the information they need to make sensible decisions.

Our food safety policy promotes consumer choice and consumer safety We introduced the 1990 Food Safety Act to ensure the highest standards of food hygiene.

    We will introduce legislation designed to give consumers confidence that what they purchase is properly described - and that adequate compensation is offered where these requirements are not met.
    We will enable the courts to override unfair terms in contracts and improve our powers to deal with rogue traders.
    We will ensure that guarantees mean what they say, and that manufacturers or importers share responsibility with the people who sell their goods.
    We will tighten up the rules on holiday brochures and contracts, and introduce a 'cooling-off' period into timeshare contracts.
    We will introduce legislation to simplify trade mark registration and extend the rights they confer.
    We will enforce science-based controls on the use of chemicals in food production, and will maintain our policy of open access to information on pesticide safety.
    We will improve standards of food labelling in close consultation with consumer representatives.
