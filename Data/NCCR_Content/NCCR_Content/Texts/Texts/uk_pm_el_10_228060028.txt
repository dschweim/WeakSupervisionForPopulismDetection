Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

Make politics more transparentWe will publish details of the money government spends and the people it employs. People willhave a right to government data to make the performance of the state transparent. We will cut theunaccountable quango state and root out waste.Government has been far too profligate forfar too long. Billions are wasted each year onpointless bureaucracy and failed projects whiletaxpayers are left to foot the bill. The explosionof unaccountable quangos, public sector ‘nonjobs’and costly bureaucracy is an indictment ofLabour’s reckless approach to spending otherpeople’s money. Once again, it underminespublic trust in the political process.We understand that people want governmentto be more effective in what it does, and to doit for less money. That means transformingthe way the state goes about its business,using decentralisation, accountability andtransparency to reduce dramatically the costof government. And, because sunlight is thebest disinfectant, we will bring the operation ofgovernment out into the open so that everyonecan see whether we are delivering good valuefor money.Publish data so the public canhold government to accountDrawing inspiration from administrationsaround the world which have shown that beingtransparent can transform the effectiveness ofgovernment, we will create a powerful newright to government data, enabling the public torequest – and receive – government datasets inan open and standardised format. Independentestimates suggest this could provide a £6billion boost to the UK economy. We will openup Whitehall recruitment by publishing centralgovernment job vacancies online, saving costsand increasing transparency.A Conservative government will bring in newmeasures to enable the public to scrutinisethe government’s accounts to see whether itis providing value for money. All data will bepublished in an open and standardised format.We will:• require public bodies to publish online thejob titles of every member of staff and thesalaries and expenses of senior officials paidmore than the lowest salary permissiblein Pay Band 1 of the Senior Civil Servicepay scale, and organograms that include allpositions in those bodies;• require anyone paid more than the PrimeMinister in the public sector to have theirsalary signed off by the Treasury;
• require senior civil servants to publishonline details of expense claims andmeetings with lobbyists;• apply these transparency principles tolocal government, with the threshold forpublication of spending items and contractsset at £500, and for the publication of salariesthe same as at the national level; and,• give councillors the power to vote onlarge salary packages for unelectedcouncil officials.Curtail the quango stateUnder Labour, the quango state has flourished.Government figures show that there are over700 unelected bodies spending £46 billionevery year, but this does not even include therange of advisory bodies, public corporations,taskforces and regional government bodies thathave sprung up under Labour. We believe thatMinisters should be responsible for governmentpolicy, not unelected bureaucrats. Any quangosthat do not perform a technical function or afunction that requires political impartiality,or act independently to establish facts, will beabolished. To increase the scrutiny of quangos,we will:• give Select Committees the right to holdconfirmation hearings for major publicappointments, including the headsof quangos;• examine the case for giving SelectCommittees the power to prevent increasesin quango budgets; and,• ensure that the National Audit Office has fullaccess to the BB C’s accounts.Reduce the cost of procurementThis government has a dreadful record ofmanaging procurement, with billions of poundswasted on mismanaged projects. We will tacklewasteful government procurement projects by:• strengthening the role of the ChiefInformation Officer to get a grip ongovernment ICT projects;• introducing a series of changes to ICTprocurement to deliver better value for money;• appointing senior private sector nonexecutivesto departmental boards to deliverbetter value for money;• publishing in full government contracts forgoods and services worth over £25,000; and,• increasing the accountability of EU spendingby publishing details of every UK projectthat receives over £25,000 of EU funds.
