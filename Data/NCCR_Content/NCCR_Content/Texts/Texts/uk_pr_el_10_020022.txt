Another glitzy launch can't hide that this is another spending commitment from the Tories with the flakiest of funding solutions - Ed Balls

ed ballsEd Balls MP, Labours Schools Secretary responding to David Camerons speech today said:

"Another glitzy David Cameron launch can't hide the fact that this is yet another spending commitment from the Tories with the flakiest of funding solutions.

"Last year, Labour set out plans, backed with funding, to get more young people to volunteer.

"But what we didn't hear from David Cameron today was his plan to deny opportunities to thousands of young people.

"They refuse to match Labour's school leavers guarantee of a sixth form, college, training or apprenticeship place for 16 and 17 year olds. The Tories won't protect this area from the immediate cuts they need to find this year.

"Despite today's announcement, the truth is that David Cameron's Conservative Party still stands for opportunities only for some young people and not all.

All we saw today is a flaky plan to cut the Prevent programme which is a key part of Contest, the UKs counter terrorism strategy."
