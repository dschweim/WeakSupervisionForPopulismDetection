Text of the posting:
-------------
I’m delighted for Zac – he’s principled, hard working, and dedicated, he’s fizzing with ideas, and he’s passionate about London and its people.  

In May next year this City needs its new Mayor to be a fighter, someone who’s not afraid to knock some plaster off the ceiling in pursuit of the best possible deal for London.  

Zac Goldsmith is that fighter.  He’s fearless. He will make a brilliant Mayor.

I have no doubt he’s the best candidate we could possibly have to deliver the vital infrastructure improvements, new housing, jobs and growth London’s rapidly growing population will need in the years ahead.
