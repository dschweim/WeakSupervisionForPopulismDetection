-------------
My comments to Trevor Phillips were lauding the progress of race relations and equality in this country -- so as to say that racial discrimination in the workplace is almost unheard of nowadays. Britain's media should be proud of this fact instead of trying to do it down.

And I suggest the REAL racists in our society are those who hear me say "British" and think "white". I'm the only leader arguing for Britain's employers to favour British workers, no matter what their colour. And I must say, given the unemployment rates amongst young people , I'm now the only party leader standing up for them, black, white, or otherwise.
