Press Release from Party: UKIP

Belgium leads the way on burka ban

Friday, 30th April 2010

A burka ban is to be imposed in Belgium after the countrys fragile coalition government came together to demand that women show their faces in public.

The draft law, which has still to be rubber stamped by the Belgian Senate, is set to come into action by July. Women who refuse to comply with the regulation face a 110 fine or even a prison sentence.

Belgian MP Daniel Bacquelaine said last night: The notion of recognising people in the street is essential to maintain public order. 

It's also a question of human dignity. The full face veil turns a woman into a walking prison.

France and the Netherlands are also moving towards banning the full face covering.

In Britain, UKIP is the only serious party advocating a similar ban on wearing the burka  which is not an Islamic requirement  in all public places.

This Saturday, UKIP treasury team spokesman Christopher Monckton will be campaigning with the Partys candidate in Birmingham Hodge Hill, Waheed Rafiq.

The two UKIP politicians will receive the blessing of a Muslim Imam before addressing issues including face coverings and UKIPs belief in uniculturalism rather than multiculturalism.

Speaking today, Viscount Monckton said: Im very much looking forward to joining Waheed Rafiq in Hodge Hill and meeting members of the Muslim community.

We will certainly be discussing the Belgium ban and other issues of mutual interest.
