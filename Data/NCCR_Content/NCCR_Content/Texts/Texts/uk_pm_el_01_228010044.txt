Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Reforming Politics

Making every vote count

Democracy is the guarantee of all our freedoms, but the state of British democracy still leaves much to be desired. Liberal Democrats want to make government the true servant of the people, and we will develop a political process in which all voices can be heard.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Reform the voting system for Westminster so that every vote counts

    Give Parliament more power to hold the government to account

    Devolve more power to the nations and regions of Britain and to local authorities

Britain's political system has changed for the better since 1997. We have championed devolution for over a century, so we welcomed the opportunity to play our part in the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. We welcome too the introduction of fairer votes for these bodies.

But the gap between government and the governed is still too great. Public bodies are not sufficiently accountable. Voters do not have a strong enough voice or enough choice. No wonder that more and more people feel alienated from politics.
