Mon, 22 Mar 2010

The Government must provide exemptions from the tax for pensioners and the least well off and ensure everyone is equipped with the skills to use superfast broadband," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary for Culture, Media and Sport.

Commenting on the Governments announcement to increase access of superfast broadband, Don Foster said:

It is absolutely vital that we invest in our digital infrastructure.
 
Britain is already lagging behind other countries with faster internet speeds so intervention is needed.
 
Investment in rural areas must start early to avoid an expanding digital divide.
 
The Government must provide exemptions from the tax for pensioners and the least well off and ensure everyone is equipped with the skills to use superfast broadband.
