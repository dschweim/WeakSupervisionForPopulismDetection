Government must honour cheap tickets pledge for Olympics says Foster

Mon, 22 Mar 2010

There's no point encouraging people to register for tickets now if they can't afford to buy them when the time comes," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary for Culture, Media and Sport.

Commenting on the Government's announcement that more tickets will be available for British fans for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Don Foster said:

The announcement of a new system allowing people to register their interest in tickets for specific Olympic events is a welcome step.

It is vital however that the Government honours its original commitments on cheap ticket prices.

There's no point encouraging people to register for tickets now if they can't afford to buy them when the time comes.
