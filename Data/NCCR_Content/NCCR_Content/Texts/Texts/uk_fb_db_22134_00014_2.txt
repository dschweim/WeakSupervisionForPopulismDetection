The pay gap has fallen, but women still basically work for free for 57 days a year  which is absolutely outrageous in 2015. Thanks to the Lib Dems (https://www.facebook.com/libdems) putting pressure on the Conservatives, the coalition government is today changing the law to make large employers publish their pay gap. It will force companies to ask themselves difficult questions and give women the information to challenge their employer where they are not being properly valued and rewarded.
