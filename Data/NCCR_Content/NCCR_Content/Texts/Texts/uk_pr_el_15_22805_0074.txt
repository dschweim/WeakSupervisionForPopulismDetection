Natalie Bennett responds to Amnesty International report on migrant deaths

22 April 2015

Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, commenting on today's Amnesty International report 'Europe's Sinking Shame: The Failure to Save Refugees and Migrants at Sea' said:

"Today's Amnesty International report on Europe's failure to protect the refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean powerfully illustrates the need to take urgent action to prevent the deaths of those desperate enough to undertake the journey.

As the report highlights, many of those who attempt the most dangerous and lethal crossing in the world do so as a last resort, fleeing extraordinary danger, hardship and persecution in countries such as Syria, Libya and Eritrea.

Amnesty's report highlights the inadequacy of Triton as a response to the crisis, and the need for governments across Europe to invest in search-and-rescue operations of an appropriate size to match the scale of the problem.

 The Green Party remains the only party calling for the UK to accept more refugees from war-torn regions and to invest in international policies - including 1pc of GDP in aid - that build peace and stability across the globe."
