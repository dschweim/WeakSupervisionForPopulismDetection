We’re giving young people the best start in life.

Since 2010 we’ve delivered 2.2 million apprenticeships. And we want to go even further – delivering 3 million more apprenticeships by 2020, so young people across the country can learn a trade and get on in life.

Today we’re underpinning that commitment by announcing 16,000 more apprenticeships in just one day – many with Britain’s most prestigious companies. Each apprenticeship gives another person the skills they need to do get on and make the most of their talents.

Backing young people with high quality apprenticeships is a key part of our long-term economic plan. We want apprenticeships to be as highly valued as university degrees, helping more young people look forward to a better future.
