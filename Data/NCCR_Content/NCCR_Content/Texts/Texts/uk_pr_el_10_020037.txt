The launch took place at BMW's MINI car plant in Oxford, which benefited from the Government's action during the world economic crisis. The document sets out the choice between a Labour Government that will not take risks with the recovery by making cuts this year and the Conservatives who, given the chance, would.

Gordon Brown said:

"Our plan for growth sets out how we can create a more prosperous Britain by:

    Securing the recovery

    Backing advanced manufacturing

    Backing hi tech businesses

    Transforming Britains infrastructure

    Delivering a fair deal for business


"These are the building blocks of Labours plan for growth.

"The fragile recovery we are beginning to see would be put at risk by a Conservative government.

"They have no plan for growth. They have no view on how government working with business can support the new industries of the future.

"Instead they would cut support from the economy at the worst possible time and put growth - and the recovery at risk."
