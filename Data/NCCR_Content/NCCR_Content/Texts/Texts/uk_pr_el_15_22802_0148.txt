    Comment on Iain Duncan Smith telling Sky News that zero-hours contracts need to be renamed the ‘flexible hours contract’

    Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, commenting on Iain Duncan Smith telling Sky News that zero-hours contracts need to be renamed the ‘flexible hours contract’ said:

    “Iain Duncan Smith’s comment shows again how completely out of touch David Cameron’s Tories are with the lives of working people. We don’t need to rename exploitative zero-hours contracts, we need to ban them.

    “For too many people zero-hours contracts leave people without a regular income and not knowing from one day to the next how much work will be coming in. It’s insecurity dressed up as flexibility.

    “David Cameron said he couldn’t live on a zero-hours contract but the Tories are happy for working people to be stuck in low paid zero-hour contract jobs.

    “A Labour government will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts to give working people security at work.”
