Press Release from Party: SNP

UK threat to Navy's presence in Scotland
Tue, 23/03/2010 - 18:55
The Labour Government has come under fire after a parliamentary question revealed that the Royal Navys presence and capability in Scotland has been cut to an all time low  with a further cut due within weeks. 
A parliamentary question by SNP Westminster leader and Defence spokesperson Angus Robertson MP has revealed that Labour has cut the number of vessels by 31% since 1997 to 8 conventional vessels  and 5 nuclear powered submarines, of which 4 are armed with nuclear weapons of mass destruction. In contrast Norway has some 70 vessels in service - none of which are nuclear powered or armed. 
An earlier question by the SNP Westminster leader has revealed that HMS Walney, one of the navys eight Sandown Class mine hunters which are based in Faslane, is to be axed in April. The mine hunters are the only conventional Royal navy vessels based in Scotland.
Mr Robertson said: 
Labours shameful record on defence cuts has been laid bare, with a further cut to our conventional fleet due within weeks. 
Our capabilities have been run down by Labour, and this parliamentary question reflects the reality of Labours 4.3 billion defence underspend in Scotland over recent years, which have seen 10,000 defence jobs disappear. 
While Labour cuts the number of conventional ships in Scotland from 8 to 7 the Norwegian navy, in contrast, has a 70 strong conventional fleet.
Downing Street keeps making the wrong choices on cuts  whether its cutting vital manpower, aircraft and bases while blowing billions on a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons. These are the wrong choices and underline exactly why Scotland needs SNP champions in Westminster to fight further cuts.
Mr Robertsons parliamentary questions are set out below:
1. Angus Robertson: To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many naval vessels are permanently based in Scotland; and how many have been permanently based in Scotland in each year since 1997. [317783]
