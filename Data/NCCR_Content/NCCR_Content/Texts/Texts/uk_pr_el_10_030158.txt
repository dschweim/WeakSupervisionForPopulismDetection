Press Release from Party: SNP

Labour candidates in panic on Trident
Thu, 29/04/2010 - 12:15

Commenting on the report in the Herald today that reveals 21 of 59
Labour candidates have stated their opposition to replacing Trident, the
SNPs Westminster leader and defence spokesperson, Angus Robertson,
said that it was yet another sign that Labour was falling apart in the
heat of the general election campaign as panic and indiscipline break
out amongst its candidates.

Commenting Mr Robertson said:

The SNP is full square
behind not only opposing a replacement of Trident but scrapping the
present Trident system

In contrast it was a Labour government
which put in place the decision to renew Trident.

Many of those Labour candidates in Scotland who are now opposing
that replacement are only doing so because the Labour campaign is
spectacularly falling apart.

They are in a panic and grasping
for any means to get support. However the fact is their government which
wants to keep Trident and their government which is trying to lumber
Scotland with its replacement.

What Scotland needs is not yet more Labour politicians lumbering
us with the debt from weapons of mass destruction. Scotland needs local
and national champions which will consistently stand against the waste
and immorality that is Trident.
