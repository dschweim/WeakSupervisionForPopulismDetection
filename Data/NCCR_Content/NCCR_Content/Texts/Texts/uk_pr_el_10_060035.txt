David Cameron has welcomed the official announcement of the General Election date.

"People dont have to put up with another five years of Gordon Brown", he said, "because there is a modern Conservative alternative that has the energy, that has the ideas, that has the vigour, that has the leadership to get our country moving again".

Speaking to supporters, David Cameron said that the Consevatives are "fighting this election for the great ignored".

"Young, old, rich, poor, black, white, gay, straight. They start our businesses, operate our factories, teach our children, clean our streets, grow our food, keep us safe. They work hard, pay their taxes, obey the law", he will say.

"Theyre good, decent people  theyre the people of Britain and they just want a reason to believe that anything is still possible in Britain".

Cameron said the election was about the future of our economy, society and country, and explained why a Conservative Government will deliver real change.

"Its not just because were going to produce some more policies, its not just because were a different bunch of Ministers, or because were going to do things in a slightly different way", he said.

"We want a whole new approach to how we govern our country. Weve had the biggest boom and bust in our economy and we need a whole new economic model. We have got deep problems in our society and we need really big social change to mend that broken society, not just asking what can the Government do for me, but asking instead what can we all do together to make our country stronger."

"When people vote Conservative they are voting for hope, theyre voting for optimism, theyre voting for change, theyre voting to give this country the fresh start we so badly need. That is what this election has got to be about."
