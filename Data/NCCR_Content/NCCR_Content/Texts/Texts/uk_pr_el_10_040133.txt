Mass immigration policies pursued by both Labour and Conservative parties havecaused English-speaking children to become a minority in 1,500 schools in Britain and if left unchecked, will see British people reduced to an absolute minority within 30 years.

According to a new report issued by the Department for Children, Schools, and Families, more than half the pupils in 1,284 primary schools, 210 secondary schools and 51 special schools across England now come from a non-English speaking background.

According to the report, one in seven  almost 500,000  primary pupils and just over one in ten, or 364,000, secondary students do not speak English as their first language.

Birmingham has 116 schools where more than 50 percent of pupils have English as a second language, while in Bradford the figure is 60, Leicester 34, Manchester 33, Lancashire 30, and Kirklees 30.

The new statistics confirm earlier research by BNP News which revealed that if the current Tory/Labour immigration policies are only checked but not reversed, Britain is set to be completely overrun by the Third World within 30 years.

The BNP research revealed that:

- According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), legal Third World immigrants made up 14.7 percent (7.5 million) of the population of England in 2004.(1)

- According to the ONS, 10.9 percent (or 6.7 million) of the currently resident population of Britain was not born in this country.(2)

- In 2005, the ONS issued a separate report which said that 36 percent of all births in England and Wales were not white British.(3)

- This 2005 birth rate figure does not include births to second and third generation immigrant mothers. Figures released by the ONS in January 2009 revealed that the Muslim population in Britain has grown by more than 500,000 to 2.4 million in just four years. Their population multiplied 10 times faster than the rest of society.(4)

- An August 2008 ONS population report stated that, on average, foreign women have 2.5 children each, rising to 3.9 for those from Bangladesh and almost five for Pakistani women.(5) When these figures are added in, the immigrant birth rate is estimated to be around 50 percent of all live births in England and Wales.

- The majority of the new immigrants are not from Eastern Europe, as is often widely claimed. According to the ONS figures, immigrants from Eastern Europe had 25,000 children in Britain last year  an absolute minority of the just over 700,000 live births.(6)

- According to the Birmingham City Council, 61 percent of all primary school children in greater Birmingham are of Third World origin. (7)

- Over 300 languages are currently spoken in London schools. Some of the most established of these are Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Cantonese, Mandarin and Hokkien. (8)

- Some 150 languages are spoken in schools in Reading, an indication of the extent of the invasion in Berkshire. (9)

All these statistics taken together show that the non-British ethnic population is increasing in number exponentially, and given current immigration and birth rates, will utterly overwhelm the indigenous population of Britain within the next 30 years.
