The Liberal Democrats will use the £227m fine imposed on Deutsche Bank for rigging the Libor rate to fund investment in lifesaving health equipment.

We will use the money to upgrade and replace high value NHS machines, including CT scanners and MRI scanners, to help diagnose and treat patients faster.

This funding is in addition to the £8bn-a-year extra funding the Liberal Democrats will make available to the NHS  a party red line in any coalition negotiations.
