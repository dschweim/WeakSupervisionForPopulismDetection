Nick Clegg: We are fighting 60 'Eastleighs'
27 April, 2015 @ 12:01 AM

Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today (27 April) heads to Eastleigh, the seat where Liberal Democrats scored a battling by-election victory two years ago, to showcase the party's fighting spirit.

Nick will suggest that the Lib Dems can replicate our victory in Eastleigh across the country in the coming election.

He will say: "In this General Election, we are fighting 60 'Eastleighs'.

"Every held and target seat is being fought like a by-election. In Eastleigh we proved something we have always known: we know how to hold on against all challengers and all the odds."

Nick will serve up a reminder of the party’s fighting spirit and warn pundits to underestimate our candidates at their peril.
 
He will highlight the ability of our candidates to work hard for local people and get our message across on the doorstep.

Already the campaign has reflected the party’s fearsome reputation to get out onto the streets and spread the Lib Dem message.

In our key seats:

    We have had more than a million conversations with voters since the year began.
    We have delivered more than 50m bits of literature.
     In the final week of the campaign alone, more than 2m people will have seen our messages on YouTube and Facebook.

With a hung parliament on the cards, it is the Lib Dems who can make the difference and avoid the Tories lurching off to the right with UKIP, or Labour veering left with the SNP.
 
Nick will add: “We’re not going to listen to our critics and those who write us off. They’ve been wrong about us before and they are wrong about us now.

“There’s a reason why our signs say ‘winning here’. Because we are. Winning here is in our DNA.”
