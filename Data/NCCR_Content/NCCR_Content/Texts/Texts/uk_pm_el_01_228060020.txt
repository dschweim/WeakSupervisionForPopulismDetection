Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Knowing who we are

A world leader

Common sense means valuing what makes us distinctive as a nation

    A more flexible European Union
    Veto further transfers of power from Westminster to Brussels
    No European army outside NATO
    Global free trade by 2020
    A safe haven, not a soft touch, on asylum

Britain is one of the world's most respected democracies, one of its most influential leaders, one of its most prosperous nations and one of its greatest military powers.

Our possession of all of these qualities, which we rightly value, depends upon our ability to govern ourselves. And all of them are put at risk by the threat that is now posed to our independence.

Labour have lost confidence in our ability to govern ourselves.

It's time for common sense.

The next Conservative Government will secure our independence and use Britain's great strengths to help create a flexible Europe of nations, to maintain the Atlantic Alliance and to develop the role of the Commonwealth.

"The next Conservative Government will keep the pound. We will maintain our national veto on European legislation."
