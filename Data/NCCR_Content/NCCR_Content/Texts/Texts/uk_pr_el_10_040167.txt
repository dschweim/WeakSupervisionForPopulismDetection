Press Release from Party: BNP


BNP Breaks All Records with 339 General Election Candidates
April 23, 2010

The British National Party will be contesting a record 339 constituencies at the general election on Thursday, 6th May.

Thats nearly three times the number of candidates that the party fielded at the last general election in 2005.

British National Party Chairman Nick Griffin, on his way to the BNPs manifesto launch in Stoke-on-Trent this morning, said that the 339 candidates showed just how far the party had come in the last five years.

339 candidates is a fine achievement by all our local branches and groups. The establishment tried to bankrupt us with their challenge to our constitution, but this incredible feat shows that we have come out of the ordeal that much stronger.

Voters in 339 constituencies now have a real choice on vital issues such as the Afghan war, immigration and globalisation. That can be attributed to those brave individuals who, despite the bullying tactics of the media and Labour and Tory sponsored thugs, have the courage to stand up for Britain and the British people.

Past years:

1987  The British National Party contested 2 seats, polling 553 votes.
1992  The British National Party contested 13 seats, polling 7,631 votes.
1997  The British National Party contested 57 seats, polling 35,832 votes.
2001  The British National Party contested 33 seats, polling 47,129 votes.
