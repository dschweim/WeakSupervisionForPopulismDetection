    This is a desperate Tory gimmick which nobody will believe - Leslie

    Responding to reports that the Tories plan to legislate not to raise VAT, national insurance and income tax in the life of the next parliament, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary Chris Leslie said:  

    “This is a desperate last minute gimmick from the Tories which nobody will believe a word of. David Cameron broke his promise not to raise VAT last time and if he gets the chance he’ll do the same again.

    "That’s because the Tories have made billions of pounds of promises without saying where the money is coming from. And they have extreme plans to double the pace of spending cuts next year which will see them slash tax credits for working families.

    "Labour’s policies are fully-funded, which is why our manifesto pledged not to raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax.

    "For all David Cameron’s claims, tax and benefit changes under the Tories have left families £1100 worse off since 2010. Working people can’t afford five more years of the Tories.”
