Description of the content:
--------------
In September 2014 the government introduced UIFSM in schools in England. There have recently been a number of reports in the media that the government are considering scrapping UIFSM to save money. We are calling on the government to back UIFSM and not scrap it.

Text of the posting:
-------------
It is rumoured the Government plans to scrap Universal Infant School Meals this autumn. 

All the evidence shows that this is about nutrition as well as ability to pay for food, and packed lunches often do not meet the nutritional standards of a hot cooked meal.  There is also the benefit of reducing stigma, and the instances where mainly disadvantaged children have school dinners.  The policy instead creates a culture of eating together and sharing a meal.  There are so many reasons to keep this in place.

Please add your name and share with friends and family to help us hit the 100,000 signatures we need to trigger consideration of a debate in Parliament.
