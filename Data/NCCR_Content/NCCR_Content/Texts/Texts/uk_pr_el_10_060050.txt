Let's fight Labour's cider tax
Monday, April 12 2010
Gordon Brown

In a blow to cider makers and responsible cider drinkers, the Labour Government have reaffirmed their plans to impose a 10% increase in tax on cider. Conservatives today launched local  campaigns to challenge Labour to follow Conservatives plans and scrap the cider tax.

Speaking at Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm in Truro, Shadow Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:

Today, we are launching local campaigns to get Labour to scrap their 10% cider tax. Last week they bowed to our pressure to stop the tax taking effect this month, yet theyve pledged to go ahead and impose it in June if they form the next Government.

Our plans to tax alcopops and the strongest of mass-produced cider wont punish those who enjoy cider responsibly but will curb binge drinking. Labours approach doesnt begin to solve this problem.

Labours cider tax is a harsh and unfair tax on cider makers and responsible cider drinkers. The Conservative Party is the only Party committed to fighting this tax.
