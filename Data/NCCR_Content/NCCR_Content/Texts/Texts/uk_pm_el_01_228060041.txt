Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

A proud democracy

Common sense means fewer politicians and more local decision-making

    Transfer power from central government to effective local councils
    Local referendums before large increases in Council Tax
    Abolish artificial regional tiers of administration in England
    Reform Parliament so that only English and Welsh MPs vote on exclusively English and Welsh matters
    Strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of the Government

Britain's democracy has always been one of our greatest strengths. It has made our country what it is, and has embodied and defended our freedoms.

But after four years of Labour, the way we govern ourselves has been abused. We have an arrogant and complacent Government which ignores Parliament and people. We have the anomaly of MPs from Scotland and Northern Ireland voting on laws that apply only to England and Wales. The House of Lords, historically a source of balance and independence, has suffered a botched reform.

People identify with their local communities. But under this Government they are being marginalised by alien new regional bureaucracies that are costly, unaccountable and unnecessary.

Our constitution is being perverted, and faith in politics and politicians is at an all time low.

It's time for common sense.

A Conservative Government will revitalise our democracy by giving more power to local people, and once more placing Parliament at the centre of our national life.
