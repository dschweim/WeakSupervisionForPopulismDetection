Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Business, Consumers and Innovation

Protecting consumers

and backing business

Liberal Democrats are committed to a free market economy in which enterprise thrives. Competition and open markets are by far the best guarantee of wealth creation. It is the Government's role to ensure the conditions under which innovation and competition can flourish and benefit the greatest number of people.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Ease the burdens on business

    Defend consumers against the power of monopolies

    Promote innovation and training in new technology

The UK now operates in a global market in which international competition is intense. Liberal Democrats’ social objectives cannot be achieved without the creation of wealth and the promotion of enterprise. The Conservatives have always posed as the champions of enterprise. But too often they have in fact defended vested interests and monopoly power. Labour has over-regulated in some areas and under-regulated in others. Neither party has really backed new enterprise and new ideas. Small businesses have to deal with an avalanche of red tape, while the utility and railway companies have been allowed to get away with far too much.

Liberal Democrats seek to encourage innovation and risk-taking, protect the rights of consumers and workers, and safeguard the environment. We also want to maintain the City of London’s pre-eminence as an international financial centre.
