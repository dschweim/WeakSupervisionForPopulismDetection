Salmond leads tributes to Billy Wolfe
Fri, 19/03/2010 - 13:24

The SNP's former leader Billy Wolfe has died, aged 86.

Leading the condolences, First Minister of Scotland and Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said:

"I am deeply saddened at Billy's passing, and my thoughts are with Kate and his children David, Sheila, Ilene and Patrick.

"Billy Wolfe blazed the trail in the professionalisation and organisation of the SNP - and he more than anyone transformed it into a modern political party.  Indeed, the West Lothian by-election in 1962 was the moment when the SNP broke through as a central and driving force in the Scottish political process - and the party went on to achieve outstanding success in the mid-1970s under his leadership.

"Billy was also incredibly influential in developing a social democratic ethos for the SNP in terms of its political identity - something which there were doubts about when he was leader, but which came to fruition in later years, and was vital in the success we enjoy today.

"Billy was committed to public life and the causes he believed in - working with others, for example, in the campaign for nuclear disarmament - and he will be greatly missed both within and outwith the ranks of the Scottish National Party."
