-------------
Liberal Democrats will not enter a coalition with a party not prepared to back pay rises for people working in the public sector.

They have paid more than their fair share, and now enough is enough.

The work they do is the cornerstone of a fair and decent society. We have a moral obligation to support them, and protect the services they provide.

Jobs and pay are under threat from the Conservatives. They want to embark on a slash and burn approach to the public sector. And Labours failure to deal with the economy, allowing austerity to drag on, will prolong pay restraint for many years to come.

Public sector workers have made enough sacrifices to help our country get back on track. Only Liberal Democrat MPs can guarantee an end to further cuts to pay.
