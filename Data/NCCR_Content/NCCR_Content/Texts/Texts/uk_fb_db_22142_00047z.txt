Description of the content:
--------------
Today, at Prime Minister's Questions, I put six questions to David Cameron about tax credits cuts. Despite repeatedly asking, he completely failed to assure the country that families, who are hit by these cuts, would not be worse off next year. <newline><newline>Following the vote in parliament to stop tax credits cuts, I told him "This is not a constitutional crisis; it is a crisis for three million families in this country."<newline>Here's the last two questions I asked.

-------------
At PMQs last week, I asked David Cameron six questions on tax credits cuts on behalf of thousands of people who wrote in. Six times David Cameron refused to say how many families could lose out from the cuts.

He avoided answering these questions because he knows he has no mandate to introduce these cuts as he categorically said he wouldn't during the run-up to the 2015 election. These cuts also show that Cameron is not interested in "making work pay," as they will mean 3 million families will, on average, be £1,300 worse off next year.
