Press Release from Party: LibDem

Businesses let down by a Government asleep at the wheel says Thurso

Fri, 26 Mar 2010

Businesses have been let down by Labour," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Business Secretary.

Commenting on todays National Audit Office report on support provided to business during the recession, John Thurso said:
 
Businesses have been let down by Labour. This report shows that they got less than 1 for every six that ministers announced.
 
The Government was asleep at the wheel just as the economy was driven off a cliff.

There werent even any plans on the table to help business until October 2008 despite clear signs of the credit crisis in the summer of 2007.
 
Ministers were left playing catch-up and its no wonder that schemes like the trade credit insurance top up were abject failures.
