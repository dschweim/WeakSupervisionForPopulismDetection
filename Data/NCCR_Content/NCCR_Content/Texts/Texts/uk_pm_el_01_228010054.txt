Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Rural, Urban and Suburban Life

Action for your local community

Outside their family, most people's immediate concerns involve the local community where they live, work, shop and spend their leisure time. We wish to build sustainable communities which provide for the needs of their citizens, enhance their lives, and preserve the environment.


Liberal Democrats will:

    Boost local economies by protecting local services and promoting local innovation

    Support rural employers, farming and fishing

    Revive depressed areas by introducing a one-stop regeneration grant system to distribute funds more effectively

    Create incentives for developers to build on brownfield rather than greenfield sites

Margaret Thatcher notoriously remarked "there is no such thing as society". It was an attitude which weakened communities all over Britain during the Conservative years. Now, in many communities in Britain, there is growing dissatisfaction with Labour too. In rural areas, people feel that the Labour Party does not understand their needs. In much of urban Britain, arrogant and complacent Labour councils are out of touch with local people.

Our opponents want to control from the centre. We will allow communities to make decisions for themselves, while providing high-quality services and protecting the environment.
