YouGov: Voters Want More Election Coverage for Smaller Parties

19 March 2015

Green Party Press Release

For immediate release

Spokespeople available for comment

 

* Four in ten voters say the Green Party should be given 'significant' coverage by the broadcasters

* Survey comes days after Ofcom ruled that the Greens are not a 'major party'

* Natalie Bennett: "The politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past"

A YouGov poll for the Times Red Box has revealed that 40% of voters believe the Green Party should be given 'significant' coverage (1).

The polling further calls into question Ofcom's ruling (2) that the Green Party is not a 'major party'.

Natalie Bennett, Green Party Leader, said:

"Polling such as this from YouGov clearly demonstrates people's appetite to hear more about Green values and policies.

"The broadcasters and the regulator need to recognise that the politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past.

"Denying the Green Party 'major party' status fails both our democracy and the electorate. Attempting to exclude the Green voice from the mainstream of British politics looks more and more ridiculous by the day."

The Green Party is polling at record levels ahead of a General Election. Membership of the Green Party of England and Wales sky-rocketed by 123% in 2014 and continues to surge in 2015. The current number of members of the Green Party of England and Wales stands at almost 57,000 (56,908) making the Green Party the third biggest party in England and Wales.

The Green Party is standing candidates in over 90% of seats in May 2015, meaning more people will be able to vote Green than ever before.
