Mon, 29 Mar 2010

Nick Clegg was the only party leader who suggested a year ago that MPs should be taken out of the property game altogether, and Im glad this has been taken up," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Leader of the House.

Commenting on the new expenses rules announced by Sir Ian Kennedys Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), David Heath said

I welcome what Ipsa has published today. Theyve worked very hard to get a workable scheme up and available for the start of the new Parliament.

Nick Clegg was the only party leader who suggested a year ago that MPs should be taken out of the property game altogether, and Im glad this has been taken up.

I hope the proposals will now be put in place and we can start the new Parliament with much greater public confidence in a system that is transparent and fair.
