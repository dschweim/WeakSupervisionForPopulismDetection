Growing fears of a jobless recovery under Labour
Wednesday, March 17 2010
Theresa May

Theresa May, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has said there are growing fears of a jobless recovery under Labour.

The latest unemployment figures show a fall in headline unemployment, but at the same time a fall in the number of people in employment and record economic inactivity.

"Any fall in the headline unemployment figures is welcome", May said, "but todays figures are still real cause for concern".

"With fewer people in work and fewer jobs in the economy there is now a real fear of a jobless recovery under Labour. Long term unemployment is continuing to grow and more people are giving up on work altogether disappearing from the unemployment figures."

The number of unemployed people fell by 33,000 over the quarter to reach 2.45 million. However the number of people actually in work also fell, employment levels fell by 54,000 over the quarter to reach 28.86 million. 

The employment rate for November to January was 72.2 per cent. This is the lowest employment rate since 1996.

"We cant afford five more years of Gordon Brown", May added.  To get Britain working again, she said we need "a credible plan for jobs and growth, but Labours policies will put recovery at risk, undermining confidence, threatening higher interest rates and mortgage rates and ultimately damaging jobs".
