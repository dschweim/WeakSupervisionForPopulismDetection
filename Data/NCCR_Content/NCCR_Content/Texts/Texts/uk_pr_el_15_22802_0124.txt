    Trident - national security is not a matter for negotiation - the Tories are resorting to the language of smear - Vernon Coaker

    Vernon Coaker MP, Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary, responding to desperate Tory claims on Trident, said:

    “As Ed Miliband has already made crystal clear national security is not a matter for negotiation. We support renewal of Trident along with a renewed focus on multilateral disarmament.

    “Labour is committed to maintaining a minimum, credible, independent nuclear deterrent, delivered through a Continuous-At-Sea Deterrent. This is not up for negotiation with any party.

    “The Tories are resorting to the language of smear. They are increasingly desperate as their campaign lurches on in confusion and chaos.”
