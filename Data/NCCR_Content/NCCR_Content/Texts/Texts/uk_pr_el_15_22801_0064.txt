Labour's 20 year old promise on zero hours contracts
01 April, 2015 @ 3:16 PM

Labour have failed to meet their 20 year promise to ban zero hours contracts.

In a party conference speech in Brighton in 1995, Tony Blair said that if elected Labour would bring, "and end to zero hours contracts."

He said:

"A Labour government will be part of the European Social Chapter. Part-time employees will no longer be treated as second class citizens. There will be an end to zero-hours contracts."

Labour had 13 years in government in which they could have banned zero hours contracts but they did nothing.

They even said they "wished to retain the flexibility these contracts offer business."

Labour are hypocrites on zero hours contracts, their MPs, including Ed Balls and councils have all used them.
