Change our political system to put people back in control
Wednesday, April 21 2010
David Cameron

David Cameron has set out seven steps for sorting out our political system and putting people back in control.

Speaking at a rally in Torquay, he said that people felt a "simmering anger about the expenses scandal and what has gone wrong with our political system".

Whilst the expenses issue sparked that anger, Cameron said that there were deeper causes of the frustration.

"It's not just the expenses, that's like the first chapter of the book. The rest of the book is all about how people feel they don't have any control over the political system."

"They feel that the politicians make these endless promises, they call all the shots, but nothing changes, and people can't take control, can't take power. That's what needs to change."

He went on to set out seven steps to changing our political system and giving back more control to people:

    Change the way candidates are chosen
    Sack your MP if they are caught misbehaving
    Make ministers more accountable
    End the quango state
    Make sure a government can be decisively sacked
    Cut the cost of politics
    Never pass power to Brussels without asking the people
