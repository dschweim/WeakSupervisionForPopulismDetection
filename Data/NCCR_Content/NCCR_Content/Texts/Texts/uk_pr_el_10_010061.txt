Commenting, Norman Lamb said:
 
The NHS is facing the toughest financial period in its history, yet were still seeing managers being recruited like theres no tomorrow.

Many people will be left wondering why so much money is being spent on more NHS bureaucracy when were in desperate need of frontline staff.

Labour has poured huge amounts of taxpayers money into the NHS while failing to ensure we get good value for money.

Yesterdays Budget failed to set out any credible plan for reducing costs in the NHS. Labour claimed they would make the NHS more efficient, but these figures paint a different picture.

Only the Liberal Democrats are being honest about the scale of the challenge ahead. We will start by cutting the amount spent on admin by one third and reinvesting that money in frontline services.
