We have already taken action on a wide front:

    we have set up co-ordinators in every local education authority to train teachers about the harm drugs can do, and to bring the fight against drug abuse into the classroom;
    we have set up 16 local drug prevention teams in inner cities to tackle particular problem areas;
    we have created the National Drugs Intelligence Unit at New Scotland Yard;
    we have taken the lead in Europe in pressing for the establishment of a Europe-wide Drugs Unit, as a first step towards a creation of a
    we have set up a network of 31 drug liaison officers, in 19 different countries, tracking the international drugs traffickers who threaten Britain with their trade.

    We will not legalise any banned drugs.
    We will bring forward proposals to ensure that the control of drug misuse is co-ordinated effectively.
    We intend to strengthen our confiscatory powers still further. And we will ensure that our controls against drug-trafficking are not weakened by any changes in Europe.
    We will make it an offence to supply anabolic steroids to minors.
