Party Manifesto: UKIP (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Fisheries

Whilst Britain remains in the EU, it remains entrenched in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP promotes the immoral waste of our fishery resources and forces fishermen to throw back, dead, more fish than are landed for consumption. As such the CFP represents the most illogical, grotesque and wasteful use of one of Britain's most valuable natural resources. It sums up, as a single policy, most facets of what is wrong with the EU and the centralised, remote form of administration that it seeks to impose in all areas of our national life.

The EU seeks even more control over British fishing grounds, depriving our fishing communities still further of this unique resource. And it proposes absolute central control which will reduce Britain's quotas still further, whilst allowing other EU members a greater share of our fishing grounds.

Only by withdrawal from the EU can our fishing grounds be protected and the stocks effectively managed. Fishing stocks, particularly North Sea cod, are on the point of permanent extinction. The UKIP proposes 'fishing-free' zones to allow sustainable stocks to recover, and the prohibition of certain fishing methods that are environmentally damaging and unsustainable. We will draw upon the experience and success of Norway in its management of its fishing grounds. A sustainable fisheries policy will be developed in close co-operation with our fishing communities and fisheries experts, with the primary basis being one of exclusive fishing rights allowed to the British industry (up to 200 miles) under International Law. Access by EU members and other countries will be granted by bilateral agreement.
