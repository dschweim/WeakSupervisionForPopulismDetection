Press Release from Party: LibDem

More grassroots sport needed says Foster

Wed, 17 Mar 2010

Giving children a greater choice of sports will increase sporting take up and decrease drop outs," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Culture, Media and Sport Secretary.

Commenting on todays Government announcement that 3000 new after school clubs offering Olympic and Paralympics sport will be provided for young people, Don Foster said:

We have been calling for more after school sport provision for a long time. Giving children a greater choice of sports will increase sporting take up and decrease drop outs.
 
Currently fewer than a third of children do the five hours of sport each week this Government promised. This one-off sum wont be enough to produce the huge boost in sports participation needed.
 
Grassroots sport has lost out because of lottery money being diverted to pay for the Olympics. By changing the way the national lottery is taxed, we could produce long term dividends for all good causes, including grassroots sport.
