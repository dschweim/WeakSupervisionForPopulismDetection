Talking in Berlin today the Prime Minister made it clear that he believes whole heartedly both in the European Unions doctrine of the Free Movement of People and that Britain should remain within the European Union.

What this Referendum is really about isn't the details of benefits policy, but about who governs Britain.

David Cameron is trying to make the UKs relationship with the European Union simply a question of migrant access to benefits. In reality this is a marginal detail of a far bigger problem, both with mass inward migration putting pressure on wages and causing huge problems in the provision of public services and housing and also in the broader sense of our relationship with an out of date, sclerotic over-regulated bloc.

The UK would be better off out of the European Union. Better able to trade freely and fairly with the wider world, better because it could set its own rules to suit its own circumstances, better because we would be able to elect and dismiss our Government, rather than accept the governance of an unelected bureaucracy.

Agree? Then why not join UKIP, the only party that believes Britain is more than a star on somebody else's flag.
