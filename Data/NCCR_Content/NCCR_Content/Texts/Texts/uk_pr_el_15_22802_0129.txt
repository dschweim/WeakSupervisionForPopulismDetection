    Michael Dugher, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, commenting on the Tory rail fares announcement said:

    “This announcement is unfunded, uncosted and frankly totally unbelievable. 

    "The Tories should be judged on what they’ve done in the last five years, not what they say they might do in the next five. 

    "The truth is Tory ministers have allowed rail fares to rise 20 per cent on average since 2010 and services for hard-pressed commuters to get worse. That’s why Labour has been campaigning against the Tory inflation-busting rail fare hikes since 2010. 

    "The Tories were the ones who brought back ‘the flex’ which enabled the inflation busting fares rises in the first place. 

    "Labour wants to see big changes on rail - action on fares, but also an end to the failed franchises, a public sector operator and for the first time a passenger voice to stop the rip-off railways that have defined David Cameron’s government.”
