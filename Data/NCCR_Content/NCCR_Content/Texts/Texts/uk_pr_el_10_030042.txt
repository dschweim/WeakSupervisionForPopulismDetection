Press Release from Party: SNP

Labour discredited by lobbying allegations
Mon, 22/03/2010 - 18:26
The UK Labour Government have been forced to make a House of Commons statement after a Sunday newspaper revealed former cabinet minister had been offering to lobby government contacts for commercial interests - despite still being MPs. 
Commenting the SNP MP who started the cash for honours inquiry, Angus MacNeil, said:
"The Westminster Parliament has been left totally discredited. From cash for honours, to the expenses scandal, to dodgy donors and now cash for access; the London parties have presided over a deep decline in standards in politics.
"Just when it seems trust in Westminster politics can sink no further, Labour has become embroiled in yet another scandal, and as usual the Prime Minister is running away from the problem by refusing to have an inquiry.
"With each successive episode, voters are becoming more and more disenfranchised and disheartened with politics, but at this election the SNP is offering an alternative to those let down by the Westminster machine.
"On polling day voters across Scotland will have a straight choice between SNP candidates who will champion local causes and Labour politicians who are out for what they can get."
