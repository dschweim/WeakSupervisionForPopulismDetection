Press Release from Party: SNP

Championing the things that matter
Mon, 03/05/2010 - 17:28

The revelations that two UK nuclear submarines went to sea with a
potentially disastrous safety problem that left both vessels at risk of a
catastrophic accident only highlights the reckless obsession of the
London parties with keeping the Trident system says the SNPs
Westminster leader and defence spokesperson Angus Robertson.

Meanwhile it has also been revealed that in America that the
estimated cost of the new US submarines has doubled as doubts grow over
their future in the US.

Commenting Mr Robertson said:

Todays
news only highlights why the SNP is right to identify Trident as a
major item that should be scrapped in order that we can make savings to
protect spending on the things that matter like health and education.

If the UK cannot even maintain the safety of its conventional
nuclear submarines - one of which visited Faslane when this problem was
outstanding - what confidence can we have in them ensuring the safety of
the Trident system?

And the news from the US that they are having doubts about their
Trident replacement because of spiraling costs puts further pressure on
the London parties to explain how they aim to make cuts that wont harm
front line services?

They cannot go ahead with their Trident replacement if the US does
not do so. And if the US proceeds with the costs doubling then that
begs the question of what further cuts the London parties envisage.

At
this election the SNP is the only party in the serious position to send
a strong message that people want spending protected on the things that
matter and the real cuts to be made on those things that dont like
weapons of mass destruction.
