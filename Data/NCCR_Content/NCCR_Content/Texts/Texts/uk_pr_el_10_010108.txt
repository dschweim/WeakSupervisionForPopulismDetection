Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labours cancer campaign contemptible says Lamb

Sun, 11 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrats will guarantee that people get their cancer treatment on time and if youre not treated on time, the NHS will pay for you to go private," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on Labours cancer campaign leaflets that were reportedly targeted at cancer patients, Norman Lamb, said:

If Labour has targeted people with cancer then that is contemptible and Andy Burnham should apologise for campaigning in this way.

However, its all too easy for the Conservative Party to dismiss this campaign as nothing more than dirty tricks. Andrew Lansley cannot escape the fact that Tory policy to remove NHS targets means people have no guarantee of access to cancer services within any timeframe.

Liberal Democrats will guarantee that people get their cancer treatment on time and if youre not treated on time, the NHS will pay for you to go private.
