The Conservatives are no longer the party of #defence. They've slashed our armed forces, committed us to needless, endless foreign wars, and now they have the temerity to attack Labour over doing a deal with an anti-Trident party, the SNP. 

Well who did you do a deal with in 2010 Mr Cameron? The Lib Dems, whose manifesto opposed Trident, its replacement, and Britain being a nuclear power at all.

Share the facts. #VoteUKIP.
