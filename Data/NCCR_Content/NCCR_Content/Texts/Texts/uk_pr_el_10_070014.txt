Press Release from Party: UKIP

Nuttall slams KFC's PC ban on bacon

Thursday, 25th March 2010

Party Chairman Paul Nuttall has decried the news that certain British branches of KFC have stopped selling pork products to avoid offending Muslim customers. Some branches will go even further and only sell Halal meat.

"It is a testament to the divisions wrought on this country by the failed creed of multiculturalism that KFC feel the need to do this," said the UKIP MEP for the North West.

The UKIP manifesto outlines the Partys plans to end the doctrine of multiculturalism, oppose political correctness and create a single British culture embracing all races and religions.
