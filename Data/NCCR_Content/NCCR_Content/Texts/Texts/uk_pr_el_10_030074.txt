Press Release from Party: SNP

SNP campaign for the people's seats
Sat, 10/04/2010 - 14:29

SNP Ministers are campaigning across the country as they emphasise that in this election no seat belongs to any political party - they are all the people's seats.

The SNP's Day of Action came at the end of a bad week for Labour in the General Election campaign which saw their double whammy cuts agenda revealed by the SNP and a senior aide forced to stand down as Labour's candidate for Moray after he made shameful comments on his Twitter.

Commenting, SNP Campaign Co-ordinator Stewart Hosie said:
"Across Scotland, the SNP are out in force taking our positive message to
the people of Scotland - don't just elect a politician, elect a local
champion.
"We're working hard in every seat because no seat belongs to any one party
- they all belong to the people of Scotland.
"The MPs returned to Westminster after this election will not be decided
by officials in constituency associations or party HQs in London but by
Scottish voters at the ballot box.
"SNP candidates are working and campaigning hard to become local and
national champions - speaking up for local communities and standing
against the cuts agendas of Labour and the Tories. At this election it is
only more nats that will mean less cuts."
