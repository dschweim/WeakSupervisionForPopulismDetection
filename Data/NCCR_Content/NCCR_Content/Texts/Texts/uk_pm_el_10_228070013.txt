Party Manifesto: UKIP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

9 Welfare &Social Security
The UK’s current welfare system is ridiculouslycomplicated and requires an army of bureaucratsto administer. There are more than 70 separatebenefits, each requiring masses of forms andhelping to entrench dependency. UKIP’s proposalswill humanise the system and help people tohelp themselves out of the poverty trap. UKIP will:· Roll the mass of existing benefits into simplercategories, while ensuring every UK citizenreceives a simple, non-means tested ‘Basic CashBenefit’ (BCB)· Roll key benefits - such as Jobseeker’s Allowance,Incapacity Benefit and Student MaintenanceGrant - into a single, flat-rate BCB set atthe same weekly rate as Jobseeker’s Allowanceor Income Support. For students, the BCB will betermed ‘Student Vouchers’ or ‘Training Vouchers’· Allow part-time and temporary workers tocontinue claiming BCB until their wages reachUKIP’s proposed £11,500 personal allowance sothey can take jobs without being heavilypenalised by the system· Merge Child Benefit, the Child Trust Fund, ChildTax Credits and the Education MaintenanceAllowance into an enhanced Child Benefit, payablefor each of the first three children in a family· Merge Early Years’ Funding, Sure Start, thechildcare element of Working Tax Credit and thetax relief on Employer Nursery Vouchers into aflat-rate, non-means tested ‘Nursery Voucher’ tocover approximately half the cost of a full-timenursery place· Ensure British benefits are only available to UKcitizens or those who have lived here for at least
five years. Currently, British benefits can be claimed by EU citizens in their arrival year· Require those on benefits - starting with Housing and Council Tax Benefit recipients in private rented homes - to take part in council-run local community projects called ‘Workfare’ schemes. The schemes will be in addition to council jobsDownload the full Welfare to Workfare policy from the Policies section of www.ukip.org
