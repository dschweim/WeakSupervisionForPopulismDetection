Press Release from Party: SNP

Championing BBC Alba on freeview
Tue, 23/03/2010 - 18:44

Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has expressed his
disappointment at the BBC Trust who have announced today that there will
be a delay in putting BBC Alba on Freeview, due to the fact that a
strategic review will have to be done first before any decision is made.

Mr MacNeil said:

"The BBC Trust should stop dithering,
show some leadership and make the correct decision, The Gaelic Community
have been more than patient and understanding with the foibles of the
BBC and its apparatus. This is treating the many people who took part in
the consultation on BBC Alba with disdain.

"I am very disappointed that this consultation has not done what it
promised.

"BBC Alba remains the only BBC channel not available
on Freeview. Why did the trust wait until the end of the consultation to
decide it could not make a decision?  And then blame the BBC review? It
is very late in the day."

The Gaelic Proverb Ruigidh each mall muilean describing slow but
steady progress by an old horse now appears to be talking about a
Thoroughbred racehorse in comparison to the BBC Trust."
