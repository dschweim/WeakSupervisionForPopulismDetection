Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour mismanagement has shattered confidence in immigration system

Wed, 31 Mar 2010

We can only persuade people of the enormous benefits of immigration if we have a system that is firm but fair," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on Gordon Browns immigration speech, Chris Huhne said:

Labours shambolic mismanagement has shattered public confidence in the immigration system and undermined this countrys historically liberal attitude towards immigration.

We can only persuade people of the enormous benefits of immigration if we have a system that is firm but fair.

This means securing our borders by reintroducing exit checks, planning properly for new migrants and making sure they move to where they are most needed.
