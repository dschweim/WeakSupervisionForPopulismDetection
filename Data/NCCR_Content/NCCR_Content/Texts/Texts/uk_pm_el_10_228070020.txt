Party Manifesto: UKIP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

16 Food, Farming & the Countryside
For too long, the EU and the UK’s major political parties have ridden roughshod over the concerns of farmers and rural people. UKIP will implement policies to ease key worries, breathe new life into the rural economy and enhance the countryside. UKIP will:· Withdraw from the EU and retain Britain’s seat at the World Trade Organisation so the UK can pursue agricultural trade policies that are directly in the national interest· Ensure there is no sudden loss of Common Agricultural Policy farming subsidies such as single farm payments (already paid for byBritish consumers and taxpayers). Over time, UKIP will use labelling and advertising campaigns to promote British produce and fairer food prices. This will replace the need for many subsidies· Support GM foods research and require all imported produce to be labelled so consumers can make informed choices. In the meantime, we will continue to oppose production of GM foods and be open to evolving scientific advice
· Introduce labels that differentiate between ethically-produced and non ethically-produced food products, backed by significant consumer advertising. This will empower the consumer and demonstrate the high quality of British produce and UK animal welfare standards· Review all EU imposed rules, directives,regulations, quotas, targets and requirements, and repeal or reform them as necessary under British law. This will, for example, ease the present unrealistic EU Nitrate Directive threshold and abolish it if necessary· Change legislation to allow the formation of a greater number of producer co-operatives, putting food producers on a more equal footing with supermarket buyers· Support the new Supermarket Ombudsman to ensure producers receive a fair share of retail prices· Allow county referendums to reverse the hunting ban at the local levelDownload the full Food, Farming & the Countryside policy from the Policies section of www.ukip.org
