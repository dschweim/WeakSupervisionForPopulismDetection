Only the Liberal Democrats offer real change says Clegg

Sat, 27 Mar 2010

People want something different and the only party that will deliver real change is the Liberal Democrats," said the Liberal Democrat Leader.

Responding to Gordon Browns speech today, Nick Clegg said:

It is astonishing that after 13 years in charge the best Labour can come up with is a list of vacuous pledges wrapped up in management speak.

Between them Labour and the Conservatives have failed to come up a with a single specific positive reason to vote for them.

This is the old politics and the old politics is simply not good enough anymore.

People want something different and the only party that will deliver real change is the Liberal Democrats.
