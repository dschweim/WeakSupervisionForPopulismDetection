Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

Britain's balance sheet

In drawing up this manifesto, we have begun from where Britain is today. Like any good auditor, we have been realistic about national achievements and failures, about opportunities and problems. The result is a balance sheet which shows our country's strengths and weaknesses.

Despite some points of promise and potential, Britain's balance sheet shows how much still needs to be done. The following pages reveal the extent to which, in the economy, in the environment, in education, and in local services, successive British governments have failed to realise the opportunities of the past decades. Although there are bright sports, the general picture is one of relative decline in relation to other advanced democracies.

Forty years of failure are the result not only of misjudged policies from both Conservative and Labour Governments. Even more crucially, they are the product of an outdated political system which has consistently sacrificed the long term to the short term and abandoned principles for expediency.

The Economic Balance Sheet

Positives

    In some ways, British industry is thriving. In 1991, UK exports climbed to a record level of GBP 103,804 million.
    Industrial relations have improved markedly since the 1970s. Trade unions have become more responsible and democratic. Days lost through strikes fell from more than 29 million in 1979 to under a million in the year to October 1991.
    The excessively high income-tax rates inherited from the last Labour Government have been brought down - from a top rate of 83% in 1979 to 40% in 1992.

Negatives

    Unemployment has been the most obvious cost of the current recession. The latest figures show 2,604,100 out of work. The number unemployed for more than six months has doubled in the past year.
    The recession is biting deeply into industry. Business bankruptcies have jumped from 28,935 in 1990 to 47,777 in 1991.
    High interest rates are throttling the chances of economic recovery. British three-month rates stood at 10.7% in February, compared to 9.5% in Germany, 5.3% in Japan and 4.3% in the US.
    Britain is failing to invest for the long term. Investment in manufacturing industry fell from GBP 3.1 billion in the first quarter of 1990 to GBP 2.5 billion in the last quarter of 1991.
    This failure to invest for the long term can be een also in innovation, the development of new ideas and products. In 1984-1988 only 3.4% of patents granted in the US to other national went to Britons (3.7% in 1979-83). By comparison, France had grown from 3.3% to 3.4%, and Japan managed 18.8% (against 12.9% in the earlier period).
    Britain's record of economic growth is very poor. The UK economy contracted by 2.2% in 1991 - the biggest annual fall since the 1930s - while Italy's grew by 1.3% and German's by 1.9%
    Conservative management of the economy has stoked the biggest credit boom in Britain's history. Average personal debt as a proportion of disposable household income mushroomed from 57% in 1980 to 114% in 1990.
    Conservative taxation policies may have reduced high marginal income-tax rates, but it was the rich who benefited, not the country as a whole. From the beginning to the end of the 1980s, take-home pay rose by 41.4% for those on 1.5 times the national average, by 37% for those on the national average, and by only 32% for those on half the average.
