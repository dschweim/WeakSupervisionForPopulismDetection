Gordon Brown Urges Parties to Ignore Immigration  But Britain Will Be Overrun in 30 Years
March 31, 2010

Gordon Brown has called on political parties to form a united front to ignore the Third World immigration invasion which is on the point of utterly overrunning this country within the next 30 years.

Mr Brown made his appeal in a speech on immigration today in which he called on all parties and think tanks not to engage in dog-whistle politics by not matching what they say in national speeches with what is said on the doorstep.

In essence, Mr Brown has called on his fellow Tweedledee and Tweedledum parliamentary parties to keep quiet about the extent of the invasion because talking about it helps the British National Party.

The official figures show, however, the full extent of the crisis facing Britain:

- According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), legal Third World immigrants made up 14.7 percent (7.5 million) of the population of England in 2004.(1)

- According to the ONS, 10.9 percent (or 6.7 million) of the currently resident population of Britain was not born in this country.(2)

- In 2005, the ONS issued a separate report which said that 36 percent of all births in England and Wales were not white British.(3)

- This 2005 birth rate figure does not include births to second and third generation immigrant mothers. Figures released by the ONS in January 2009 revealed that the Muslim population in Britain has grown by more than 500,000 to 2.4 million in just four years. Their population multiplied 10 times faster than the rest of society.(4)

- An August 2008 ONS population report stated that, on average, foreign women have 2.5 children each, rising to 3.9 for those from Bangladesh and almost five for Pakistani women. (5) When these figures are added in, the immigrant birth rate is estimated to be around 50 percent of all live births in England and Wales.

- The majority of the new immigrants are not from Eastern Europe, as is often widely claimed. According to the ONS figures, immigrants from Eastern Europe had 25,000 children in Britain last year  an absolute minority of the just over 700,000 live births.(6)

- According to the Birmingham City Council, 61 percent of all primary school children in greater Birmingham are of Third World origin. (7)

- Over 300 languages are currently spoken in London schools. Some of the most established of these are Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Cantonese, Mandarin and Hokkien. (8)

- Some 150 languages are spoken in schools in Reading, an indication of the extent of the invasion in Berkshire. (9)

All these statistics taken together show that the non-British ethnic population is increasing in number exponentially, and given current immigration and birth rates, will utterly overwhelm the indigenous population of Britain within the next 30 years.

It is little short of treason for Mr Brown to call for silence on the nature of this crisis which threatens our nations very existence.

The BNP will continue to campaign on these facts and the danger it poses, irrespective of whether the other parties mention them or not.

The BNP is also the only party with the policies to solve this crisis in a fair, humane and calm manner, and will continue to present its alternative to the voting public.
