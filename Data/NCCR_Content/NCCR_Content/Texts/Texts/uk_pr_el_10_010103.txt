Labour as big a block to reform as Tories says Davey

Fri, 09 Apr 2010

This real dividing line at this election is between the Liberal Democrats and the cosy Labservative consensus," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Foreign Secretary.

Commenting on Lord Adoniss call for Liberal Democrat supporters to vote for Labour, Edward Davey said:

After 13 years of failing to change Britains corrupt political system, Labour has become as big a block to political reform as the Conservatives.

Whether its on fair votes or stopping dirty money in politics, Labour has just not delivered, often working hand-in-hand with the Conservatives to stop the change Liberal Democrats are fighting for.

This real dividing line at this election is between the Liberal Democrats and the cosy Labservative consensus.

From their support for over-reliance on banking to the illegal war in Iraq, from backing unfair taxes to stopping political reform, Labour and the Conservatives have conspired against the real change Britain needs.

The only vote that brings real reform is a vote for the Liberal Democrats, everywhere in the country.
