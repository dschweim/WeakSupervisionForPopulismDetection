Ashcroft and Hagues cynical cover-up cost taxpayers says Huhne

Thu, 18 Mar 2010

Mr Hague is guilty of a cynical cover-up for a shabby decision which has cost British taxpayers more than 100 million", says the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary

Commenting on William Hagues admission of a mistake concerning Lord Ashcrofts tax status, Chris Huhne said: "William Hague promised the Prime Minister that before Lord Ashcroft received his peerage he would pay tens of millions in British tax, but then never even checked whether the promise was kept. He has treated the taxpayer with total contempt.

It is utterly unbelievable to say, as William Hague did this morning, that he was not aware of the tax implications of these negotiations that dragged on for four months when he was kept informed by his closest loyalist, the Chief Whip.

Mr Hague is guilty of a cynical cover-up for a shabby decision which has cost British taxpayers more than 100 million.

William Hague is not fit for any role in Government, let alone that of Foreign Secretary. Lord Ashcroft must now meet his 100 million tax bill.
