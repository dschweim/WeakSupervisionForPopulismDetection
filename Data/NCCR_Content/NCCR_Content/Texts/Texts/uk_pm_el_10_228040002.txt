This will result in the extinction of the British people,culture, heritage and identity.• The BNP will take all steps necessary to halt and reverse this process. These stepswill include a halt to all further immigration, the deportation of all illegal immigrants,a halt to the “asylum” swindle and the promotion of the already existing voluntaryrepatriation scheme.• The BNP recognises the right of legally settled and law-abiding minorities toremain in the UK and enjoy the full protection of the law, on the understanding thatthe indigenous population of Britain has the right to remain the majority populationof our nation.• The BNP will deport all foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain, regardless of theirimmigration status.• The BNP will review all citizenship grants awarded since Labour enteredgovernment in 1997, based on that party’s admission that they orchestratedmass immigration to change forcibly Britain’s demographics and togerrymander elections.• The BNP will repeal the Race Relations Act and all other far leftist socialengineering projects, such as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission aimedat enforcing multiculturalism.• The BNP will regain sovereign control of our borders by increasing fundingto the UK Border Agency.Environmental Protection and the “Climate Change” Theory• The BNP demands an end to the destruction of Britain’s green belt, caused primarilyby housing demand fuelled through mass immigration.• The BNP will launch a “polluter pays” policy in the fight against environmental damage.• The BNP will encourage the use of existing “brown sites” for all new buildingor industrial developments.• The BNP rejects the “climate change” theory which holds that all western nationsneed to be stripped of their manufacturing base and pay untold billions to the ThirdWorld to build up their industries.Leaving the European Union• The BNP loves Europe but hates the EU.• The BNP demands an immediate withdrawal from the European Union, which isan organisation dedicated to usurping British sovereignty and to destroying ournationhood and national identity.• The BNP will end the annual multibillion cash haemorrhage Britain pays out to the EUin membership fees and regulatory costs.
