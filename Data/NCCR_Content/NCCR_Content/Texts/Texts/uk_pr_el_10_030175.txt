Salmond wins debate championing Scotland
Mon, 03/05/2010 - 11:53

Alex Salmond convincingly won this evening's BBC Scotland election leaders' debate, while Labour's Jim Murphy was left facing renewed scrutiny in ongoing fallout from the Westminster expenses scandal, over the "flipping" of his homes in Scotland and in London for mortgage purposes.

SNP Depute Leader and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:

"Once again, Alex Salmond was the clear winner of this debate in what was a statesmanlike performance that underlined the SNP's positive vision for Scotland  in contrast to the cosy Westminster consensus of the London-based parties.

"On all the subjects raised - from the economy to immigration and Afghanistan - the SNP were once again in the ascendancy after last week's hands-down win in Sky's Scottish leaders' debate.

"In contrast, Jim Murphy completely lost it over flipping his homes. First of all he denied he had done so, then confirmed he had before launching an extraordinary attack on the BBC's Glenn Campbell for making 'very serious allegations' against him.  Labour were already losing the debate, but this was the point they plunged to a new low in Scotland.

"After being shut out of the UK leaders' debates, this was an opportunity to showcase the SNP's alternative to the cuts agenda of Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems - and that is a message we will take to voters on the ground across Scotland in the final days of this campaign.

"A show of hands in the debate audience also showed that most people were in favour of a balanced parliament.  In Scotland that means voting for SNP local and national champions to help protect the country from the Westminster parties cuts agenda."
