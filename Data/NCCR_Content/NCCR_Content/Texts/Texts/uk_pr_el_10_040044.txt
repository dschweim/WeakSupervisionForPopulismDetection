Last week 50 residents from the flood hit areas of West Cumbria travelled to the European Parliament in Brussels to see a presentation on the reasons behind the devastation caused on November 19th 2009.

The coach left on Tuesday at 11.00pm and after driving through the night crossed the English Channel to Belgium on an early morning ferry.

After unpacking at their hotel in Brussels, the party was then driven to the European Parliament where they were welcomed by the MEP for the North West of England Nick Griffin, and his fellow BNP MEP Andrew Brons.

In an exhibition room in the Parliament, the delegation from West Cumbria was show a film on what caused the floods made by Nicks Parliamentary Assistant Eddy Butler and then were given a talk and slide show by Nick Griffin.

After the presentation was over, it was back to the hotel with the MEPs and their staff for an evening meal.

The next day it was another visit to the Parliament this time for a talk and tour of the building. After a lunch in a Parliament restaurant it was back on to the coach for the trip home.

While travel on the continent was incident free, back in England the A1 was closed down at Wetherby which meant a two an a half hour diversion via Darlington to get back on to the A66 at Scotch Corner.

After dropping off at stops in West Cumbria the last passengers finally left the coach at five oclock on Friday morning.
