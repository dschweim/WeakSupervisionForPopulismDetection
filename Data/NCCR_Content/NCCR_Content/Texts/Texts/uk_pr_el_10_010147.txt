Wed, 21 Apr 2010

"This is shocking behavior and rubs salt into the wounds for those who have been stranded overseas," the Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary said.

Commenting on Ryanairs decision not to compensate customers after European airspace was shut down for six days, Norman Baker said:

Michael OLearys outrageous decision not to compensate customers after the upheaval of the last week is a blatant defiance of EU consumer rules.

This is shocking behavior and rubs salt into the wounds for those who have been stranded overseas.

This will make people think twice about travelling with Ryanair in the future.
