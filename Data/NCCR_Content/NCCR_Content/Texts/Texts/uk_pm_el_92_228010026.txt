Widening Horizons: Investing in the Arts

The arts benefit in two ways. First, access to the arts is intrinsic to a high quality of life. Second, the cultural sector - the arts, crafts, design, and audiovisual industries - make as great a net contribution to the economy as does the oil industry.

We will:

    Create a new Ministry of Arts and Communications headed by a minister in the Cabinet. Liberal Democrats will raise investment in the arts to the EC average over five years.
    Reform and decentralise arts funding and organisation. We will decentralise many of the responsibilities of the Arts Council, increasing the roles of Regional Arts Boards and local authorities.
    Strengthen links between the arts and education. We will enhance practical arts teaching and library provisino in schools and extend the provision of adult education for the arts and crafts. We will restore funding for public libraries to 1980 levels. We will abolish museum charges for school parties.
    Transfer responsibility for broadcasting to the new Ministry. The BBC is a major patron of the arts, and broadcasting and to guarantee political independence. These interests will also be reflected in the impending review of the BBC's Charter, and our plans for cable television.
    Encourage participation within Europe - including in particular cooperation in the film industry, inprotecting and enhancing our common heritage and in expanding opportunities for young artists of all kinds.
