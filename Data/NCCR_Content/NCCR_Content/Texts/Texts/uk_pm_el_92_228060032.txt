HIGHER EDUCATION

Britain maintains the best university system in Europe. We have also developed a thriving network of polytechnics, whose student numbers have increased nearly sixfold since the end of the 1960s.

By the year 2000, one in three young people will follow full-time higher education courses. Meanwhile, the number of mature entrants to higher education has risen by 65 per cent since 1979. And our universities are attracting increasing numbers of foreign students.

Despite this huge expansion, our students enjoy one of the most generous support systems in the world. The introduction of student loans has given students 30 per cent more money for their living costs than the former system of grants alone. The new system will steadily reduce the proportion of students' living costs that their parents are expected to meet.

    We will continue to expand the number of students in higher education. We are abolishing the artificial 'binary line' between universities and polytechnics.
    We are putting in place new mechanisms to ensure that academic standards are maintained in higher education.
    We will continue to provide generous support for students and to expand our student loans commitment.
