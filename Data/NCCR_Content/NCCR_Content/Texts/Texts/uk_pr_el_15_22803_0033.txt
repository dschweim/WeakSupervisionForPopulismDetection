Hosie: SNP MPs to stand up for fairer future

Joining families in Camperdown Park in Dundee, SNP Depute Leader Stewart Hosie has today underlined the need to vote SNP to make Scotland’s voice heard at Westminster – and secure a fairer future for families across the UK.

Stewart Hosie said:

“This election offers Scotland – and the rest of the UK – the chance for change, breaking out of the mould of two and three party politics.

“Last week’s seven party Leaders’ Debate showed there is an appetite across the UK for progressive voices to be heard. Put simply, it’s time for Westminster to sit up and take notice.

“Hard working families across the UK simply can’t afford another five years of cuts. But that is all that is on offer from Labour and the Tories as they plan to implement £30 billion further austerity – while spending £100 billion renewing Trident weapons of mass destruction.

“It is no wonder that the SNP’s message of progressive politics is striking a chord across the country. Westminster needs to listen to the needs and concerns of ordinary families.

“And as the Westminster establishment kicks into panic mode, they will pull out all the stops to halt the SNP. Their dirty tricks and actions to promote a lie published in Tory supporting newspapers shows the lengths they will go to in order to protect the broken political system they hold dear.

“But working with other progressive parties across the UK, the SNP holding the balance of power can lock the Tories out of government, push for an alternative to austerity and work toward the progressive change and fairer future we all want to see.

“The more seats the SNP has at Westminster, the louder Scotland’s voice will be.”
