Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour hasnt delivered on 2005 maternity choice pledge says Lamb

Tue, 16 Mar 2010

"Labour promised mothers a choice over where to give birth at the last election but they simply havent delivered," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on Gordon Browns announcement that expectant mothers will be given new rights about where they give birth, Norman Lamb said:
 
Gordon Brown is living in a fantasy land. Labour promised mothers a choice over where to give birth at the last election but they simply havent delivered.
 
Mothers arent being given a choice because there simply arent enough midwives to handle the growing birth rate. Nothing that Labour is proposing will address that problem.
 
Rather than reeling off even more undeliverable pledges, Labour should concentrate on delivering on the promises theyve already made. Recruiting extra midwives so that everyone can have a safe birth should clearly be the number one priority.
