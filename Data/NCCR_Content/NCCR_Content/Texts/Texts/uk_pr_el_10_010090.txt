Press Release from Party: LibDem

People will decide next Government, not a ministerial has-been

Sat, 03 Apr 2010

Neither Labour nor the Conservatives will ever bring the change Britain needs, only the Liberal Democrats will," said Nick Cleggs Chief of Staff.

Commenting on Geoffrey Robinsons comments on the Today Programme about a possible Labour-Lib Dem government after the election, Danny Alexander said:

Gordon Brown's Labour Government has been an abject failure. He has presided over the worst recession for more than 60 years, widened the gap between the rich and the poor, created a hugely unfair tax system and a rotten political system.

Neither Labour nor the Conservatives will ever bring the change Britain needs, only the Liberal Democrats will.

After years of Labour failure, the Liberal Democrats are fighting to deliver change. It will be for the British people to decide who forms the next Government, not the fantasies of a ministerial has-been.
