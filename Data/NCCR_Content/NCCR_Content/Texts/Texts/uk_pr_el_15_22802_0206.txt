    Ed Balls, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, responding to David Cameron’s latest interview on child benefit:

    “After days of weasel words and prevarication David Cameron is still failing to rule out cutting child benefit and tax credits again.

    “All he has said again is he won’t abolish child benefit, but he won’t deny he plans to cut it or take it away from millions of families.  Everyone knows it’s impossible for the Tories to achieve their £12 billion of cuts to social security without hitting family budgets hard.

    “Child benefit and tax credits are now on the ballot paper next week. While Labour will protect them, the whole country now knows the Tories will cut them again.”
