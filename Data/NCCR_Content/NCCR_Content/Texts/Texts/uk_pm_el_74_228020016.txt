Party Manifesto: Lab (uk) - National Elections 1974
-------------------------------------

A Charter for Women

Changes in our society over recent years have emphasised the importance of providing practical equal opportunities for women rather than making polite noises about equality. We have already made a start towards equal citizenship by giving British women, married to foreign husbands, the same rights as British men with foreign wives.

The Labour Government's decisions provide a new deal for women. We will:

    ensure that by the end of 1975 Labour's Equal Pay Act will be fully effective throughout the land;
    introduce a comprehensive free family planning service;
    legislate for equality of treatment in social security;
    make provision for maternity leave;
    introduce a new child cash allowance to be paid (including the first child) usually to mothers;
    extend nursery education and day care facilities;
    bring a fairer system of family law with new family courts;
    reform housing law, to strengthen the rights of mothers on the break-up of marriage: and introduce other reforms proposed by the Finer Committee on One Parent Families;
    increase educational opportunities for girls, including further education, training and compulsory day release. 

We also intend to legislate directly on new rights for women, through a Sex Discrimination Bill as set out in our White Paper. The proposals cover: employment, training, education, housing and the provision of goods, facilities and services (including mortgages and H.P., etc.) There will also be new machinery to ensure the enforcement of these measures.

But of course all our proposals - about prices and consumer protection and homes and education and full employment - will help to improve life for all the women of our country.

And we are determined to see more of them from all walks of life - in Parliament, on local councils and other public bodies - including political parties and trade union committees.
