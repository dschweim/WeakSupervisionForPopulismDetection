The barefaced cheek of David Cameron is breathtaking - Cooper

Yvette CooperYvette Cooper MP, Labours Work and Pensions Secretary responding to David Camerons hypocrisy on a recent visit to Liverpool said:

The barefaced cheek of David Cameron is breathtaking.

David Cameron has opposed every single penny of the funding for the Future Jobs Fund, and his party has pledged to abolish it. Yet now he turns up telling young people that he thinks it is a "good scheme".

If he is so keen to keep the Future Jobs Fund, perhaps he will share with the world how he would pay for it. And if he cant, he should stop making young people promises he doesnt intend to keep."

The Future Jobs Fund was announced in Budget 2009, and is funded as part of the extra 5bn of discretionary borrowing Labour has put into helping people back to work. This extra inv estment is increasing through the recovery  from 2bn this year to 3bn next year (2010-11).

The Conservatives opposed all of the discretionary borrowing for the Future Jobs Fund. At the Conservative Party conference the Tories pledged to abolish the Future Jobs Fund.

The Fund is creating 205,000 additional jobs, many of which will start next year, primarily aimed at 18-24 year olds who have been out of work for 6 months. It is part of delivering the youth guarantee of jobs, training or work placements for all young people.
