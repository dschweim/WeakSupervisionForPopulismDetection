Press Release from Party: LibDem

Stamp out sexualisation of children by big retailers says Lynne Featherstone

Wed, 14 Apr 2010

"Young children need our protection and shouldn't be the prey of greedy retailers selling them adult products," the Liberal Democrat Spokeswomen for Equality said.

Commenting on the announcement by retailer Primark today that it will stop
selling padded bikini tops for children, Lynne Featherstone said:

"Primark's decision is welcome but how on earth could they have thought
that this was a good idea in the first place?

"Young children need our protection and shouldn't be the prey of greedy
retailers selling them adult products.

"I will be writing to all the big retailers and asking them to pledge to
stamp this kind of sexualisation of children."
