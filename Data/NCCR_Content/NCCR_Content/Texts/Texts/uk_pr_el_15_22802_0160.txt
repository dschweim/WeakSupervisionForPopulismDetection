    Response to Health Service Journal reports that four out of five hospitals are short of nurses

    Andy Burnham, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, responding to Health Service Journal reports that four out of five hospitals are short of nurses said: 

    “These figures are yet more proof of the shortage of nurses in the Tory NHS. But David Cameron is drawing up plans to cut 2,000 nursing posts after the election. Hospitals are already at their limits and it will push them over the edge. 

    “It is now clear that, just like last time, Cameron’s NHS promises have an expiry date of election day stamped on them. The NHS simply cannot take five more years of David Cameron.

    “Labour has set out a better plan to invest £2.5 billion extra each year - on top of Tory spending plans - paid for by a mansion tax on homes worth £2 million, to fund 20,000 more nurses and 8,000 more GPs.”
