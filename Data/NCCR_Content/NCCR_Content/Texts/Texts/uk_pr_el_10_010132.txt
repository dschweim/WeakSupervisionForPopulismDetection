Press Release from Party: LibDem

Goldman Sachs allegations suggest greed and corruption in banking says Lord Oakeshott

Fri, 16 Apr 2010

We thought the crisis had been caused by a combination of greed and incompetence; it now looks like greed and corruption," the Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson said.

Commenting on the decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US to charge Goldman Sachs and one of its vice presidents with defrauding investors linked with subprime mortgages in the run up to the banking collapse, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott said:

If these allegations are true it shows the extent to which greedy bankers would go to pull the wool over the eyes of their customers and the regulator.

We thought the crisis had been caused by a combination of greed and incompetence; it now looks like greed and corruption.

This is a shocking example of how bankers have run rings round the regulator, gambling on the back of the taxpayer guarantees.
