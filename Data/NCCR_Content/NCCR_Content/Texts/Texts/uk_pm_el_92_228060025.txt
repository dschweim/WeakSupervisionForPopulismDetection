THE POST OFFICE

The Post Office is among the best in Europe for speed and reliability of its letter services. Traffic has grown by 50 per cent in a decade in which it has operated without a subsidy Last year the first-class letter service achieved record improvements in reliability The local post office is a vital and valued feature of the rural community.

In 1981 we introduced private competition for deliveries costing over £1. This led to the rapid growth of the private courier industry with substantial benefits to business users. We believe that further benefits to consumers would flow from additional competition.

    We are committed to maintaining a nation wide letter service with delivery to every address in the United Kingdom, within a uniform structure of prices, and with a nation-wide network of post offices.
    We will legislate to set up a new independent regulator to advise on issues affecting Post Office customers, and on the progressive introduction of competition.
    We will set performance targets for the Post Office and ensure they are published in all offices, together with results achieved.
    We will ensure there is effective redress for customers where services fail.
    We will lower the limit on the Post Office monopoly much closer to the level of the first class stamp.
    We will provide improved scope for contractors to carry mail to final delivery offices.
    We will consider requests to license limited specialist services to compete within the Post Office monopoly.
