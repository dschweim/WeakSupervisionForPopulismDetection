Press Release from Party: LibDem

Labour has failed to spend well on health says Lamb

Wed, 24 Mar 2010

Labour has completely failed to implement the type of reforms necessary to ensure that the NHS runs efficiently," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on figures released today by the Office for National Statistics which reveal that productivity in healthcare fell by 3.3% between 1995 and 2008, Norman Lamb said:

This is yet further evidence that you cannot simply throw money at the NHS and expect it to be used well.

Labour has completely failed to implement the type of reforms necessary to ensure that the NHS runs efficiently.

Many people will be concerned by todays figures because we know that above inflation funding for healthcare in this country is about to come to an end.

We need a new approach to the NHS. The Liberal Democrats will cut the enormously overblown NHS bureaucracy and invest that money back into frontline services so we get more bang for our buck.
