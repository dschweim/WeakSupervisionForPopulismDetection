The stark choice at this election: competence or chaos
Post date: 30/03/2015

As the Prime Minister said today, in 38 days Britain faces a stark choice: competence with the Conservatives or chaos under Labour.

You can choose to put David Cameron in Downing Street, leading a strong team that’s working through a long-term economic plan.

Or you can choose a weak Ed Miliband, propped up by the SNP – with no plan other than more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.

You can choose a government that’s growing the economy to create jobs and invest in public services – and that will cut income tax for 30 million people.

Or you can choose the chaos of Britain under Labour – with higher unemployment, higher debts and higher taxes on hardworking families.

And Labour’s campaign is already demonstrating clear signs of that chaos:

    New figures show that every working household would be landed with £3,028 of tax rises under Labour – as a result of Ed Miliband’s inability to take difficult decisions on spending.
    Labour have unveiled an advert of business supporters in the Financial Times – but many of those figures are already distancing themselves from Labour.
    Ed Miliband said this morning that our economy ‘can’t grow without secure public finances’. But yesterday Lucy Powell, Labour’s election co-ordinator, confirmed that they would borrow more.
    Ed Miliband admitted today that he would put up corporation tax – which the Centre for Policy Studies, the independent think tank, says could cost almost 100,000 jobs.

Last time they were in power, Labour wrecked the economy by spending, borrowing and taxing too much. They haven’t learned their lesson and would do the same again – with hardworking taxpayers paying the price.

SHARE this post and let everyone know that only the Conservatives have the plan and the leadership to secure a better future for you, your family and for Britain.
