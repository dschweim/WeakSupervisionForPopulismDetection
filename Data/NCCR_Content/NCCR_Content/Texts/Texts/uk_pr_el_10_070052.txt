Press Release from Party: UKIP

Lord Pearson on supporting Eurosceptics

Thursday, 29th April 2010

UKIP Leader Lord Pearson of Rannoch has issued the following statement regarding the Party's election strategy in some marginal seats.

"I understand those in UKIP who want to fight all our 560 seats in the traditional way. There are however a few very marginal seats where if we do so, we will prevent a committed Eurosceptic from being elected. We will not win those seats, and we will thus send a Europhile to Parliament instead.

"In some of these seats, we are not fielding candidates, and are actively helping the Eurosceptics. In others, we are fielding candidates, but I would like them to support the Eurosceptics and attract the votes of the other parties.

"I have never made any secret about this strategy, and stood on this platform when I ran for the leadership. Of course I regret that some of my colleagues at local level do not agree with me. UKIP is a very democratic party, and they are free to act as they see fit.

"I will continue to put our Country above party politics."
