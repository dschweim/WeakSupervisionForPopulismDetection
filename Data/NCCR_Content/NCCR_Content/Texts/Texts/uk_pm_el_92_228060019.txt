Party Manifesto: Con (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

SCIENCE AND INNOVATION

British science has an unrivalled reputation for ground-breaking research. We believe in investing in scientific research because it enriches the quality of our lives and provides the feedstock of industrial innovation. The science budget has grown by 24 per cent in real terms since 1978-9. Increasingly funding will reflect the quality of the research output so that the best centres can truly be world leaders.

The Government spends nearly £3,000 million a year on civil research and development - at least as high a proportion of national income as the Japanese or Americans. And since 1978, British industry's spending on R&D has increased by 37 per cent in real terms.

    We will continue to support our science base to maintain the excellence of our science and to ensure that we produce the skilled technical people we need.
    We will encourage the transfer of people and technology from universities to businesses and upgrade the LINK scheme, which funds joint research.
    We will encourage the establishment of centres of technological excellence linking industrial research organisations with universities and polytechnics.
    We will continue to develop new innovation schemes for small and medium-sized businesses, including the highly-regarded SPUR programme to provide help with the development of new products and processes.
