Press Release from Party: BNP


Labour Admit  Media Lynching Helping BNP
March 29, 2010

Labour Party chiefs have acknowledged that the constant attacks on the British National Party by the media is in fact winning the party support rather than turning voters away.

Now thats bad news for the near-bankrupt Daily Mirror and the Sunday People which are being cynically used by the anti-BNP lobby. The newspapers run anti-BNP stories in almost every issue in a desperate attempt to stop voters turning to the British National Party.

Tom Watson, a former Government minister and the man in charge of orchestrating Labours campaign against the BNP at the General Election has warned that that negative reporting is counter-productive.

He cited the example of the Sun and its attacks on Gordon Brown and the Labour Party  which he called a media lynching  claiming it was actually helping Labour.

Watson said: We should thank the Sun. We go up in the polls whenever they attack us.

And, of course, Tom Watson is correct  a media lynching is what the British National Party has been subjected to for years and the party has reaped the benefit by winning two MEPs, a London Assembly member and over one hundred county and borough council seats.

Only last November the media lynching of Nick Griffin on the BBCs Question Time programme led to a record number of membership inquiries to the party.
