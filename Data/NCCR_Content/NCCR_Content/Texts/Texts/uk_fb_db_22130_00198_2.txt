Text of the posting:
-------------
"If you invest in job creation you get more people in work in decent paid jobs, and that would bring more money into the tax pot.

We are not saying the deficit shouldn't be reduced, but it should be done in a way that takes care of people and makes sure that people have work.

An artificial deadline is the bit which I have a problem with - because you just focus on balancing the books and you disregard everything else.

Then what we see is those with the least suffering the most and that's something we want to bring an end to."
