Press Release from Party: LibDem

Liberal Democrat response to the Labour manifesto

Mon, 12 Apr 2010

"Every Labour manifesto since 1997 has been full of promises they have broken. They simply cant be trusted to do a single thing they say," Nick Cleggs Chief of Staff said.


Labours manifesto is full of broken promises, scaled-back pledges, policies lifted from the Liberal Democrats and proposals that simply do not go far enough.

In the attached document, we detail where Labour has failed and why it should not be trusted to rectify its mistakes.

Commenting, Danny Alexander said:

Every Labour manifesto since 1997 has been full of promises they have broken. They simply cant be trusted to do a single thing they say.

The tax system is less fair than when Labour came to power.

The only party that is committed to making Britain fairer is the Liberal Democrats.
