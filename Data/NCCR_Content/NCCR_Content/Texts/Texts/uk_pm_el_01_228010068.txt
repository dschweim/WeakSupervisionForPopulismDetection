Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Britain's Economy

Freedom to thrive

No Government can deliver freedom without creating a sound and sustainable economy, in which business can thrive, the environment is safeguarded and employees are properly protected, nationally and internationally.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Create a competitive and sound economy to deliver prosperity for all

    Enable British euro entry, subject to the decision of the British people in a referendum

    Make taxation and spending policies clearer and more accountable

    Strengthen the independence of the Bank of England

The Conservatives were incompetent stewards of the British economy. The Thatcher and Major years went from boom to bust to boom and bust again. While some made their fortunes, sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and farming suffered a steady decline. The Conservatives failed to make the public investment needed for the long term, starving schools, training and the transport system.

Labour has done too little to redress the mistakes of the Conservatives. They were too timid in their first three years in power, failing to recognise the very poor state of the public sector.
