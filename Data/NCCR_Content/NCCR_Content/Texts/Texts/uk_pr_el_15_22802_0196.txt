    Tory refusal to rule out cutting tax credits is an extreme risk to working families - Reeves

    Responding to the Tories’ failure to rule out cutting tax credits, Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said,

    “The Conservatives’ refusal to rule out cutting tax credits shows they plan extreme cuts after the election which are a risk to working families.

    “With little over a week to polling day, David Cameron and George Osborne should come clean about their plan to make millions of working families worse off.

    “Only Labour will protect family budgets and raise living standards by raising tax credits to at least in line with inflation every year.”
