Press Release from Party: SNP

More Nats means Less Cuts
Sat, 17/04/2010 - 13:39

Responding to Tory shadow Chancellor George Osborne's visit to East Renfrewshire on the campaign trail today (Fri), SNP leader and First Minister Alex Salmond said:

"George Osborne and David Cameron have made it clear they are intent on butchering Scotland's public services if they are given the chance.

"They have Scotland firmly in their sights, and their so-called 'needs-assessment'-based funding formula is nothing more than a special Cameron Cut just for Scots - over and above the savage cutbacks they plan across the UK as a whole.

"Only the SNP is offering an alternative to the cosy cuts consensus of all the London parties, and a strong bloc of SNP MPs acting as local and national champions will help protect Scotland from that cuts agenda."
