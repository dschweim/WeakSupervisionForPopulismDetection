Party Manifesto: Lab (uk) - National Elections 1974
-------------------------------------

Agriculture

Labour will encourage the maximum economic production of food by the farming and fishing industries. We inherited from the Tories an extremely grave crisis in the agricultural industry - with extremely high feed costs, and the cereals sector succeeding at the expense of the livestock sector.

A Tory Government negotiated entry into the EEC and removed the long-term guarantees to the livestock industry. The Intervention System of the Common Agricultural Policy has not worked. Labour insists that there must be a new approach, with a clear emphasis on national aids, and that we must be able to provide suitable guarantees to our farmers.

We have already taken urgent action:

    A special subsidy on pigs, representing an injection of £30 million to the UK pig industry;
    The near doubling of the calf subsidy, providing an extra £35 million a year.
    A new beef premium, an arrangement which gives another £40 million to the producers;
    The restoration of the lime subsidy which was abolished by the Tories - worth £5 million a year.
    A temporary subsidy on the oil used for heating glass- houses - which injects a further £7 million into the horticultural industry. 

We will, in addition, introduce in the very near future, considerable help to the dairy industry.

Our long-term objective is to secure the expansion of the industry. We intend to continue our discussions with the Farmers' Unions - and the agricultural workers - with the dual objective of drawing up a meaningful longer term expansion and of determining the means whereby this can be achieved.
