Party Manifesto: BNP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

The Economy: Putting Britain Back on the Roadto Recovery
• A BNP government would tackle the national debt problem by cutting expenditureon all projects which do not serve British interests.• These expenditures which will be cut include the annual costs of £18 billion spenton “global warming,” the £13 billion spent on immigration, the £4 billion spent onasylum, the £15 billion spent on EU membership, the £9.1 billion spent on foreignaid, the billions spent fighting illegal and immoral foreign wars, and the billionsspent on “politically correct” social engineering projects.• The BNP undertakes not to reduce front-line public services while billions of poundscontinue to flow out of the country to foreign interests. British people must benefitfirst from British tax income.• The BNP aims to relieve the tax burden by raising the personal non-taxableallowance to £12,500.• The BNP will encourage the family unit by reintroducing the married man’s allowanceby as much as £2,500, depending upon the presence of children.• The BNP will raise the inheritance tax level to £1 million.• The BNP will work for a reduction in council tax through the slashing of all politicallycorrect council functions and “diversity” schemes.• The BNP would take some of these savings and invest them in rebuilding Britishindustry and skills through an active protectionist policy as many other Europeannations already do.• The BNP will rebuild Britain’s skills base — lost through decades of deindustrialisationcaused by successive Tory and Labour regimes — by offering generous subsidiesto students who study engineering and science and to institutions offering sucheducation.• The BNP will ensure that globalist corporations pay their fair share of the tax burden.We will close down the legal loopholes which allow tax evasion through TransferPricing and the outsourcing of jobs to foreign nations.• The BNP will therefore introduce legislation to ensure that a foreign acquisitionof any significantly-sized British company is judged to be in the public and nationalinterest before it can proceed.• The BNP will pass legislation to separate utility (high street) banks from theinvestment banking sector to prevent a repeat of the credit crisis.• The BNP will oppose the privatisation of natural monopolies such as Royal Mail.How Britain’s Industry and Economy Has Been DestroyedBritain’s economy today is built upon a foundation of unsustainable rising debt and record trade deficits.The Lab/Lib/Con alliance long ago abandoned any attempt to run the British economy for the benefit of the nation and have surrendered it to the dead hand of EU regulation and a rootless, amorphous globalist philosophy.Inept governments, trades union militancy during the ‘60s and ‘70s and the increasing momentum of globalisation have combined to wreak extraordinary damage to the British economy, our industry and technology.Britain, which was once a world leader in many technological and scientific fields, has had entire industrial sectors of our economy extirpated.Factories, long closed or transferred overseas, cannot be re-opened when vital technical skills have been lost. ‘White flight’ or indigenous emigration, estimated to be in the region of half a million per year, has meant the loss of many of our skilled technical workers.Any policy designed to repair this damage will take many years to complete and must involve governmental restructuring of both the educational system and the economy.The tiger states of East Asia, such as South Korea and Singapore, operate their economies and industries in the national interest and that is the economic model which Britain should emulate.Education’s Key Role in Rebuilding BritainOfficial figures show that our country lacks engineers and scientists, a sad indictment on a nation that has produced approximately 50 percent of the world’s inventions.These and other skills, which have been permitted to decline, will be invigorated under a BNP government.We shall offer generous subsidies to students — both in terms of their coursework and accommodation — who embark upon such study.Only in this way can new industries, skills and inventions be created upon which the manufacturing, engineering and scientific base of our nation can be reinvigorated.We shall also increase funding to the research, scientific and technological departments of our universities, tripling it in the first two years and progressively raising this investment as results accrue.The BNP fully endorses the “Manifesto for Physics” issued by the Institute of Physics which, independently of our party, calls for an increase in funding for the scientific community’s educational programme.Reinventing and Rebuilding British IndustryIt is nonsensical that Britain exports it know-how and many of its most talented people to overseas competitors so that they may develop their industrial base and then undercut and undermine our industries at home.Our task will be to redevelop our industrial, scientific, technological and manufacturing base and, in so doing, reinvent our economy.In pursuance of this aim, we shall place significant criminal penalties on the export of technology and inventions, which will be permitted only by government license.Cutting Government ExpenditureWith the current budget deficit at record heights, it would be grossly imprudent to increase Government borrowing, except in a case of dire emergency.Fortunately, a British National Party government would find considerable scope to raise revenues without increasing the tax burden.Unlike the other parties, the BNP plans to cut all expenditure which is not in the national interest, rather than cutting front-line services to the British people. These cuts would include:- The Climate Change ScamThe cost of so-called man-made climate change is estimated at some £18 billion per annum.The BNP has highlighted the nonsense that has been employed in support of this fraud, visited upon the electorate by the three old gang parties in order to facilitate international governance and opportunistic corporate profit.The £18 billion levy is made up of subsidies and the ‘green levy’ that is charged to current energy bills. Consumers pay these disguised costs often without even being aware.- The Immigration RacketThe cost of the multicultural society (which has been imposed without any debate whatsoever by the three old gang parties and promoted by the Greens, UKIP, the SNP and Plaid Cymru) is estimated to be in the order of £13 billion per annum, according to MigrationwatchUK.This embraces the cost of social security, crime, health tourism and NHS costs, translation expenses, unemployment, equalities legislation, education, related bureaucracy and much else.The asylum swindle costs Britain in the region of £4 billion per year in terms of benefits, housing, support and legal fees.- EU MembershipThe cost of the EU for Britain in membership fees falls a little short of £15bn. Whilst a portion of this flows back to Britain, it may only be spent in such a manner as is prescribed by unelected EU officialdom.The costs related to EU membership are in reality far higher.The Taxpayers’ Alliance has estimated the savings to the economy of withdrawal from the EU, largely in terms of the regulatory burden, at £118 billion, and this does not even count the cost of damage inflicted upon our agricultural and fisheries industries.While the halting of this cash haemorrhage will not immediately accrue to the Treasury, it will boost the British economy and ultimately enhance the taxable revenue base.According to Open Europe, the expense of complying with EU rules cost each Britishhousehold £4,912 over the past 11 years.- The Foreign Aid ScandalThe cost of overseas aid is currently at some £9.1 billion per year. This cash goes directly to nations who very often are not in need of such aid (China and India, both of whose economies are larger that Britain’s), or to utterly corrupt states where it serves no good at all.To make matters worse, it is the declared intention of all the other parties to increase foreign aid to around £13 billion per year.The BNP would halt all foreign aid while there is poverty and deprivation inside Britain.- Quangos and Politically Correct Social Engineering SchemesBillions are spent every year funding assorted quangos such as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and the myriad of ethnic organisations.By cutting funding to these schemes and eliminating waste, bureaucracy, inefficiency, and unnecessary jobs in these quangos, we anticipate saving at least some £10 billion per year.- Illegal and Immoral Foreign WarsThe BNP will immediately end British involvement in all illegal and immoral foreign wars into which the Tory/Labour regime have plunged Britain.The cost of the war in Iraq is estimated to have been some £49 billion, while the cost of the war in Afghanistan is set to rise from £3 billion to £5 billion per year.
