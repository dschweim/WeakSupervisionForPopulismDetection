The UN resolution on ISIL is an important moment. Today, the world has united against ISIL.

The international community has come together and has resolved to defeat this evil, which threatens people of every country and every religion.

The United Nations Security Council has unanimously backed action against this evil death cult in both Syria and Iraq. It has also reiterated its determination to secure a political solution to the conflict in Syria.

Today’s vote shows beyond doubt the breadth of international support for doing more in Syria and for decisive action to eradicate ISIL.

Britain will continue to support our allies who are fighting ISIL in Syria.

I will continue to make the case for us to do more and to build support in Parliament for the action that I believe is necessary for Britain to take to protect our own security, as part of a determined international strategy.

We cannot expect others to shoulder the burdens and the risks of protecting this country.
