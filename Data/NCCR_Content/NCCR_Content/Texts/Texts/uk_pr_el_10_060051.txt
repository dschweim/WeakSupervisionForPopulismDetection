We've heard it all before and nothing changes

The Conservatives have responded to the Labour Party's "empty" manifesto, saying "weve heard everything in it before".

"We've had thirteen years of broken promises and nothing ever changes", said Michael Gove, speaking alongside Liam Fox.

There have been over 100 broken promises from Labour's 2005 manifesto. The Conservatives have called for crowdsourced responses to their 2010 manifesto to expose misleading references.

Gove said that the Conservative manifesto launched tomorrow "will reveal policies that demonstrate the energy, the leadership and the values needed to bring about change, to get our economy moving, to mend our broken society and crucially to rebuild trust in our broken political system".

"In all these areas where urgent action is needed, Labour is either empty, silent or misleading", he said.

Gove and Fox spoke as they published the Conservative response to the Labour Manifesto. You can download the full response here, or view it in the document reader below.

The response questions why there is no reference to our national debt, and includes:

    Five promises they dont know how to pay for
    Five promises they wont be able to deliver
    Five promises theyve broken before
    Five promises that are undermined by their own record
    Five promises theyve stolen from us

Explaining the Conservative inititative to crowdsource responses to the manifesto, Shadow Treasury Minister Greg Hands said: "The Conservatives are today publishing Labours 2010 manifesto in an open and interactive format so that you can dig through the detail of Labours latest set of election promises".

"Its up to you to highlight the reannouncements, the U-turns, the stolen policies, and the re-heated pledges."
