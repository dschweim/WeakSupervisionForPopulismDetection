Press Release from Party: SNP

Labour caught out scaremongering
Thu, 22/04/2010 - 15:36

Stewart Stevenson today lambasted the Labour Party over their scaremongering on concessionary travel.  

Answering a question from a Labour backbencher on the concessionary travel scheme, the Minister for Transport attacked the way in which the Labour party have tried to mislead voters by placing factually incorrect material on their election leaflets, including one distributed by Margaret Curran.   

Commenting, SNP MSP Christina McKelvie said:   

No wonder the public have lost trust in the Labour party. They dont have any respect for the people of Scotland and will say anything to cling on to power and their Westminster salaries.   

The SNP have absolutely no plans to cut free bus travel - in fact this SNP Scottish Government has extended the scheme. Protection of the concessionary travel scheme lies at the heart of the SNP's Five Point Plan for pensioners, which the First Minister Alex Salmond unveiled this week.   

"It was not the SNP, but the old Labour administration who launched the former review of the scheme. The levels of hypocrsy displayed by this sorry excuse for an opposition are breathtaking. 

Labour will come to realise that their dishonest electioneering will get them nowhere. The people of Scotland will not be scared into voting for them.
