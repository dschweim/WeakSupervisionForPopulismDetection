    Comment on Education Select Committee report - Tristram Hunt

    Tristram Hunt MP, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, commenting on the Education Select Committee Report published today said:

    “This is a damning report confirming that David Cameron’s government contributed to the ‘sense of crisis and confusion’ in Birmingham schools after the so called ‘Trojan Horse’ scandal and that the Department of Education was ‘slow to take an active interest’ in the allegations. 

    “The Government’s schools policy failed children and parents in Birmingham, leaving them open and exposed to unsuitable influences for years, and they still have no plan for tackling such issues - schools and parents are still dangerously unsupported.

    “Labour has a better plan. We will introduce a robust system of local oversight for all schools, with new Directors of School Standards on the ground in every area, responsive to local concerns and acting quickly to stop poor performance taking root in any of our schools.”
