Every working family in Britain would be hit with £3,028 more in tax if Labour get into power, meaning less financial security for hardworking taxpayers.

Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have committed Labour to £30 billion of structural deficit reduction by 2017-18 – which will have to be paid for with spending cuts or tax rises.

We already know that Ed Miliband would like to see a “a 50:50 balance between taxation and spending to reduce the deficit” (Source: Ed Miliband, Left Foot Forward Interview, 8/07/10).

So under Labour hardworking taxpayers would fund 50% of deficit reduction - meaning an average tax rise of £3,028 for every working family in Britain by 2020.

All Labour’s planned tax rises so far are to pay for spending increases, not deficit reduction. So they’ll need to raise more.

Only National Insurance, Income Tax or VAT increases can raise the level of revenue Labour need for their sums to up – so it is impossible for them to rule out raising all three of these taxes, costing jobs and hitting hardworking families across the country.
