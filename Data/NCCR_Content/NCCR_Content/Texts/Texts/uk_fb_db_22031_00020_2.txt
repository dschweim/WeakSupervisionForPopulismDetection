-------------
After five years of pay restraint, public sector workers deserve to see light at the end of the tunnel and feel the benefits of the economic recovery.

Workers across the public sector have made enough sacrifices. They have done their bit to help get the country back on track.

The Liberal Democrats will ensure employees in the public sector are no longer subject to real term cuts in their pay from the first full year of the next parliament.

No more pay freezes or below inflation pay rises. We can do this because with the Liberal Democrats, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
