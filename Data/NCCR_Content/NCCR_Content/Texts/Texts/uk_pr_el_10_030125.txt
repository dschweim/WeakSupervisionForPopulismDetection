Press Release from Party: SNP

BBC shut out Scottish voters
Thu, 22/04/2010 - 14:08

Responding to the BBC Trust's decision today (Thu) to reject the SNP and Plaid Cymru's appeal against the Corporation's decision to exclude the parties from its election leaders' debate, party leader and First Minister Alex Salmond said:

"The exclusion of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, parties of Government in Scotland and Wales, from the election leaders' debates, is a democratic disgrace.

"Today's decision shows that the BBC has given up all pretence of being a national broadcaster for Scotland. Fairness and impartiality have been  thrown out of the window in what amounts to blatant discrimination against both parties and both countries.

"The Corporation has jettisoned more than 80 years of impartiality for the electoral convenience of the London-based parties.

"There can no longer be any question that the leaders' debates are dominating the election campaign, but licence fee payers in Scotland and Wales are being short-changed as the result of an undemocratic carve-up which cuts both nations out of the picture.

"With today's decision, the BBC has proved it is part of the same discredited establishment machine as the Westminster parties which the electorate are raging against."
