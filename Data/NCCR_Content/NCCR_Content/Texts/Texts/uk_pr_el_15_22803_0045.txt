Election opportunity to lock Tories out of office
Thu, 16/04/2015 - 16:09

David Cameron’s short visit to Scotland today has underlined the opportunity Scotland has at this election to lock the Tories out of Downing Street by electing a strong team of SNP MPs.

The SNP has warned that the Tories cuts plans would cost the equivalent of £2,300 per head to every person in Scotland and repeated its challenge to Ed Miliband today to match the SNP’s promise that it will never put the Tories into office.

The Scottish Tories also faced embarrassment today after their manifesto contradicted itself. While on the one hand it promises to implement the Smith Commission recommendations, it also plans to ban Scottish MPs from voting on income tax decisions – flying in the face of the Smith Commission’s recommendations.

Commenting, SNP Depute Leader Stewart Hosie said:

“David Cameron may have been in and out of Scotland in record time today, but this election is an opportunity to lock him out of Downing Street for good.

“Another Tory Government would mean a further five years of cuts equivalent to £2,300 per head for every person in Scotland. It would be a disaster for Scotland and would have a devastating effect on communities across the country.

“Electing a strong team of SNP MPs will let Scotland lock David Cameron out of Downing Street and ensure that Scotland’s voice cannot be ignored at Westminster.

“The SNP has made clear that we will never put the Tories into power. The question for Ed Miliband is why has he refused to match that commitment?”
