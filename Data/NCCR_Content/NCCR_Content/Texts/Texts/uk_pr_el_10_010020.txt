Press Release from Party: LibDem

Cuts without growth wont help deficit says Cable

Mon, 15 Mar 2010

We must not cut Government spending too soon and risk plunging a fragile recovery back into recession," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor.

Commenting on the EU Commission report that recommends that more should be done to cut Britains fiscal deficit, Vince Cable said:

The Government's position on the size of the structural deficit and the speed at which it must be cut is the minimum.

We must not cut Government spending too soon and risk plunging a fragile recovery back into recession.

Cuts without economic growth will not deal with the deficit.

To be credible all parties must not only show when they will tackle the deficit, but also what they will cut.
