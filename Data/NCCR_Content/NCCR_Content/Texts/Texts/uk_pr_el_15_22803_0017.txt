Lib Dem claims on Scotland have “no credibility"
Fri, 27/03/2015 - 17:37

Commenting on the publication of a Treasury paper on Scotland’s finances later today – and the advance Lib Dem press release on the issue – SNP Depute Leader and Treasury spokesperson Stewart Hosie said:

“The Lib Dems and Danny Alexander – George Osborne’s loyal sidekick in pushing through Tory cuts – have no credibility whatsoever in Scotland.

“And in the week when their top civil servant was slapped down by a Commons committee over his blatant bias in the referendum campaign, nobody in Scotland believes a word the Treasury say.

“Today, they have given up all pretence of impartiality with this contrived paper – issued hours in advance of publication via a party press release.

“The Treasury ignore the fact Scotland has paid more in revenues per head in every year of the last 34 years, including more than £300 billion in oil receipts to the UK exchequer – and also ignore the fact that the UK Government is estimated by the OBR to require borrowing of a further £150 billion in the five years to 2019-20.

“There is a clear dividing line between those, like the Lib Dems and Danny Alexander, who want us to be at the mercy of Westminster cuts and those of us who want Scotland to have the powers needed to do better.

“The only risk to Scotland’s public finances and services are the cuts planned by all the Westminster parties. And the key to our long-term economic success and ability to invest in our public services is giving Scotland the economic tools needed to grow our economy and boost revenues.

“Electing a powerful group of SNP MP in May will help stop a further wave of cuts and help us deliver those powers to Scotland.”
