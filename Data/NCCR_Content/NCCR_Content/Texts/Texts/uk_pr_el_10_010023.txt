Press Release from Party: LibDem

Parties must agree to a Commission on social care funding says Lamb

Tue, 16 Mar 2010

"Both parties need to agree to a cross-party Commission designed to reach agreement within a year," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on todays Kings Fund report on social care, Norman Lamb said:

Todays report supports the Liberal Democrat view that the fairest way to fund social care in the future is through a partnership between individuals and the state.

While everyone agrees that the social care system is in urgent need of reform we have to be realistic about the state of the public finances. Thats why its so important that all the major parties sit down together and work this out.

Older voters wont be fooled by Labour and Tory attempts to win their votes with piecemeal policies. Both parties need to agree to a cross-party Commission designed to reach agreement within a year.
