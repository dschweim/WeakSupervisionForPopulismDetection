Party Manifesto: BNP (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

Freedom for All:The Restoration ofOur Civil Liberties
• The BNP will repeal all legislation enacted by successive Labour and Tory regimeswhich have usurped the British peoples’ basic civil liberties.• The BNP will circumvent the erosion of our liberties by the old gang parties underthe guise of “fighting terrorism” by dealing with the root causes of Islamist extremismin Britain, namely mass immigration and Britain’s biased foreign policy.• The BNP will repeal all laws aimed at restricting freedom of speech, including thoserelating to race relations and religion.• The BNP rejects ID cards as an undesirable manifestation of the surveillancesociety.• The BNP will repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, both of which are exploited to abuse Britain’shospitality by the world’s scroungers.• By withdrawing from the EU, the BNP will not permit British courts to be subservientto international bodies or courts which override the law of the British parliament.Terrorism and the Growth of the Totalitarian StateThe BNP condemns the erosion of essential democracy in Britain which has developed partly as a result of the increasingly disastrous multicultural experiment.Britain today faces domestic terrorism from Islamists as never before in our history — caused directly by the twin policies of mass immigration and a biased Middle Eastern foreign policy.On the one hand, the old gang parties have encouraged mass immigration which has created a large pool of disaffected Muslims in Britain, and on the other hand the same parties have actively pursued aggressive foreign policies which have served to incite the now UK-resident Islamic population.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have provided extra fuel to Islamists seeking to recruit terrorists from the millions-strong Muslim population in Britain.In other words, the old parties have created the “perfect storm” for terrorism in Britain — and now used this self-created problem to justify ever-increasing repressive legislation and the destruction of our civil liberties.A prime example is the Civil Contingencies Act which grants ministers wide-ranging powers during an emergency, including the right to amend any Act of Parliament except the Human Rights Act.Islamist terrorism in Britain will not be stopped by repressive laws, but by dealing with the immigration problem and adopting a neutral foreign policy.Dismantling the Repressive StateThe BNP will repeal all laws designed to suppress our traditional right to freedom of speech, including those relating to race relations and religion.We note that these laws are rarely enforced when those of non British ethnic descent denigrate and abuse the racial and religious groups indigenous to Britain.The BNP will halt all moves to introduce ID cards as an undesirable manifestation of the surveillance society.The BNP will repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.This Act and the Convention have a long record of thwarting the rights of the majority and the espousal of politically correct causes.For example, the British government has recently been forced to prepare measures to enable the right of prisoners to vote — an altogether unjustifiable imposition.Similar rulings have prevented the deportation of criminal elements and terror suspects.By the same token, we shall not permit British courts to submit to international bodies or courts that override the law of the British parliament.The BNP will not permit the extradition of Britons to foreign jurisdictions unless the laws they are alleged to have broken correspond to offences in the UK. We will reintroduce the requirement of proof and we shall revoke the European Arrest Warrant.
