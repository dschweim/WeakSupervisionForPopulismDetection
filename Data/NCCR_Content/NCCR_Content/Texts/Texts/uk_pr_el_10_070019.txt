Press Release from Party: UKIP

Belgian politicians move to ban the burka

Wednesday, 31st March 2010

UKIP leader Lord Pearson has welcomed Belgiums moves to ban the burka from streets, parks, schools and all public buildings.

All five parties in Belgiums coalition government have backed the draft law, which will be put to a vote of the full house by the end of April.

Meanwhile in France, politicians are pressing ahead with plans to outlaw the full body covering, which the countrys immigration minister, Eric Besson, has described as a 'walking coffin'.

Lord Pearson said: It is good to see that the French and the Belgians are moving in our direction on this important issue.
