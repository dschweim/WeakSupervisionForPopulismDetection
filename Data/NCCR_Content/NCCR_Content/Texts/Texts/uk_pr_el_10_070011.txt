EU budget plans 'hypocrisy'

Wednesday, 24th March 2010

UKIP's Marta Andreasen has blasted EU plans to increase its own budget to a record level which would see each Euro MP costing four times that of their Westminster counterparts.

Ms Andreasen, a member of the parliament's budgetary control committee, attacked Brussels "hypocrisy" at a time when the European Union is urging governments to implement cuts to national budgets.

"The European institutions are preaching economy for all except themselves. In difficult financial times, European taxpayers are expected to dig even deeper to finance vanity projects, private cars and more junkets. How much more gravy does Europe want on the gravy train?," she said.
