UKIP: Straight talking on immigration

Friday, 30th April 2010

The three leaders of the old political parties failed to come to grips with the thorny question of immigration in the last of the Prime Ministerial Debates, with Cameron and Clegg descending into a slanging match over the issue.

Following Gordon Browns assertion this week that Rochdale grandmother Gillian Duffy was a 'bigot' for asking him about uncontrolled EU immigration, the Lib Dem leader made a ham-fisted attempt to tackle the problem, claiming repeatedly that 80% of immigration to Britain is from the European Union.

With immigration emerging as one of the key issues in this election campaign, Clegg should know that the true figure is closer to 40%, with immigrants from the rest of the world making up the 2.5 million influx to this country since 1997.

Disturbingly, Cameron did not realise the Lib Dem leader had made a mistake. The Tory leader's blunder shows that all three leaders, while giving lip service to the concerns of normal British people  over immigration, haven't the foggiest idea of what they are talking about.

Meanwhile, UKIP wants to freeze all immigration for five years to allow Britain's infrastructure to recover before introducing an Australian-style points-based visa system.

The full immigration policy, including details on how UKIP intends to triple the number of borders agency staff and deport all illegal immigrants, is available to download here.
