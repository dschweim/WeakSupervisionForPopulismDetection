Press Release from Party: LibDem

Liberal Democrats pledge biggest rail expansion since the Victorians

Mon, 05 Apr 2010

High speed rail is hugely important, but it is only part of the 21st century rail network Britain needs. Our plans will reopen thousands of miles of track across the country and make our railway great again, said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary.

The Liberal Democrats have set out radical plans to revitalise the railways by improving and reopening rail lines and stations.

The party will set up a Rail Expansion Fund of nearly 3bn from which councils and transport authorities can bid for money to pay for rail improvement and expansion projects.

This fund will come from cuts to the major roads budget. Commenting, Norman Baker said:

The Liberal Democrats will transform the railways with the biggest expansion since the Victorian age.

Labour has allowed the railways to wither on the vine and punished passengers with huge fare hikes while more polluting forms of transport have got cheaper. All the while, the Tories have been sharpening the axe they will take to the transport budget.

High speed rail is hugely important, but it is only part of the 21st century rail network Britain needs. Our plans will reopen thousands of miles of track across the country and make our railway great again.
