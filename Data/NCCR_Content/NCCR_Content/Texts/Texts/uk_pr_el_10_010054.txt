Unfair Council Tax makes poorest pay through the nose says Goldsworthy

Wed, 24 Mar 2010

Council Tax is an unfair tax which makes the poorest pay through the nose and it needs to be scrapped," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary.

Commenting on the Government announcement that Council Tax is to rise by an average 1.8% this year, Julia Goldsworthy said:
 
In this tough financial climate, councils will have to make cuts and need to be given as much information as possible so they can make the best decisions for their local areas.
 
But the Government is leaving councils in limbo by refusing to tell them how much their funding will be slashed in the years ahead.
 
Council Tax is an unfair tax which makes the poorest pay through the nose and it needs to be scrapped.
