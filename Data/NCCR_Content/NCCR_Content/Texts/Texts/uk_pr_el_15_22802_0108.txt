    Very disturbing that every day we hear of more British citizens being radicalised or trying to travel to Syria to join a vile barbaric organisation - Yvette Cooper

    Yvette Cooper, Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, said:

    “It is very disturbing that every day we hear of more British citizens being radicalised or trying to travel to Syria to join a vile barbaric organisation. We know that over 600 have already travelled to Syria including teenagers and children.

    “Far more needs to be done to stop extremism in all its forms. New powers are needed in addition to the work the police do on investigation and prosecutions so that anyone returning from trying to join ISIL can be required to undertake the Channel de-radicalisation programme.

    “The Prevent programme also needs to be completely overhauled because it isn’t working well enough. The police can’t do it all. We need far more community led prevention work including action in schools and helping parents who are worried that their children may be being groomed or radicalised. And we need to tackle extremists who are operating in communities or online. Communities themselves need to do more - but they also need help from Government, and that has been cut back.

    "The police are rightly investigating this latest case and it is particularly disturbing that children are involved. Much more needs to be done by everyone to combat extremism and radicalisation.
