Thu, 01 Apr 2010

The RMT must put the problems of the railway ahead of political point-scoring," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary.

Commenting on the High Court injunction preventing next weeks planned rail strikes, Norman Baker said:

This is good news for passengers who would have been the innocent victims of the strike.

However, this is a temporary reprieve. Its time for Network Rail and the RMT to get back round the table.

The RMT must put the problems of the railway ahead of political point-scoring.
