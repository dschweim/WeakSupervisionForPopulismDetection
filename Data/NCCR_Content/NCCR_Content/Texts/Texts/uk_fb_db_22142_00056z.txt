Who loses what from the government's tax credit cuts? Today Lords will vote on the plans to cut tax credits - the extra support working families get to top up low wages. Many families will lose over £2000 next year. We believe the government should rethink this policy - working families simply can't afford to bear the brunt of the government's public spending cuts.<newline><newline>http://cpag.org.uk/content/who-loses-what-tax-credit-cuts

Tonight, Labour Party Peers will vote against tax credits cuts. Child Poverty Action Group explain how these cuts will affect families across the UK:

"With over two thirds of children growing up in poverty living in a working family, tax credits are a vital tool to help families make ends meet."
"Many independent experts have already pointed out the impact these cuts will have on families: £4.4 billion will be taken from low-paid families next year alone, an average of £1350 per family."
