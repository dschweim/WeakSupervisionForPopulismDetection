UKIP launches small business policy paper

Tuesday, 4th May 2010

Small business leaders will today welcome the launch of UKIPs progressive policy on small business. The new paper comes as a Sage UK survey of small business owners shows that 77% regard the current tax system as too complicated.

Starting from the assertion that small businesses are the lifeblood of the British economy, UKIPs policy paper sets out a future for innovators and entrepreneurs free from excessive regulation and overbearing taxes.

Key recommendations include: a return to a culture of apprenticeships and vocational training; a huge reduction in regulation, achieved by leaving the EU; a phasing out of employers national insurance over five years; and a reworking of business rates so that landlords take some of the pressure away from tenants.
