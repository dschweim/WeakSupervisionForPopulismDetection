Clarke blows hole in Tory Trident policy says Davey

Thu, 22 Apr 2010

David Cameron will need to make clear this evening whether he agrees with his Shadow Defence Secretary or his Shadow Business Secretary," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Foreign Secretary.

Commenting on remarks made by Ken Clarke that alternatives to Trident should be considered, Edward Davey said:

Ken Clarkes comments have blown a gaping hole in Tory policy on Trident.

The Conservatives have claimed that there are no alternatives to the 100bn like-for-like replacement of Trident. They have said explicitly that it should be excluded from the defence review.

Now Ken Clarke says there is a case for exploring cheaper alternatives. On the eve of the most important defence review for a decade, the Conservatives are in total disarray on the future of the nuclear deterrent.

David Cameron will need to make clear this evening whether he agrees with his Shadow Defence Secretary or his Shadow Business Secretary.
