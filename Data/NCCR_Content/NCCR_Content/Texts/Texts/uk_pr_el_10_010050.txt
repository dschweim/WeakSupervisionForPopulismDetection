Wed, 24 Mar 2010

This report completely refutes the Governments often repeated claims that the detention of children only happens in exceptional circumstances," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on todays HM Inspectorate of Prisons report into Yarls Wood Immigration Removal Centre, Chris Huhne said:
 
This report completely refutes the Governments often repeated claims that the detention of children only happens in exceptional circumstances for short periods.
 
Children who have committed no crime are being held at Yarls Wood for months at a time. This barbaric practice has to stop now.
