Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 2001
-------------------------------------

Green Action

Global Climate Change

We will place Britain at the forefront of climate change negotiations, pressing other nations to ratify and implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol by the Rio+10 world summit in mid 2002. We will seek to extend its terms and targets further. We will ensure that Britain achieves its target well before the deadline, and establishes a new target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010.

Introduce Stronger Environmental Objectives

We will campaign to introduce stronger environmental objectives into the Common Agricultural Policy, lending and investment policies of the IMF, World Bank and regional development banks. WTO rules should respect environmental principles as long as these are applied in a non-protectionist way.

Promote Sustainable Development

We will ensure that environmental and social sustainability is a prime objective of aid and technology transfer policies.

Improve Environmental Governance

The Rio+10 summit in 2002 is an opportunity to improve the international community’s ability to tackle environmental threats. We want a substantial increase in resources for the UN Environment Programme and for the implementation of environmental agreements. We also advocate a UN Economic and Environmental Security Council for Sustainability.
