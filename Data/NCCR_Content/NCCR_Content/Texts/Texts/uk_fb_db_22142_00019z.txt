-------------
Labour's Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, gave an important speech today about the economy that Labour wants and Britain needs. 

"A new economy, where technology liberates rather than traps. Where the fruits of scientific advance are shared by all. And where everyone of us has the opportunity to develop our talents."
