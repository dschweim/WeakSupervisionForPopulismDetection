Our pledges will be paid for out of specified cuts to major items of public spending that we have identified; foreign aid, the EU, HS2 and the Barnett Formula (Scotland).

"We have said that we will put £3bn of these savings into the NHS, meaning that by the end of the parliament we will have provided 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives."

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: ""Mr Cameron's spending plans are unfunded, but he'll know this already. He knows he needs to make these promises, because he's planning for an immigration bombshell into this country over the next five years, and under his plans, our National Health Service will become an International Health Service."
