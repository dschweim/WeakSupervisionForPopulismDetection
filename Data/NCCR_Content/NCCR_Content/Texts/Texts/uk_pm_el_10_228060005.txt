Change the economy | Introduction

Get the economy moving
Gordon Brown’s debt, waste and taxes have wrecked the economy and threaten to kill therecovery. A Conservative government will take action now to cut the deficit, stop Labour’s jobstax, help keep mortgage rates low and get the economy moving. We will create a new economicmodel built on investment and savings, not borrowing and debt.
