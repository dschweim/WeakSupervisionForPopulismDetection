Press Release from Party: LibDem

Humiliating defeat of flawed social care Bill says Lamb

Wed, 17 Mar 2010

Labour should be ashamed of its failure to deliver a fair long-term care system for elderly people," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on the Governments defeats today in the House of Lords on the Personal Care at Home Bill, Norman Lamb said:
 
This is a humiliating defeat for the Government on a shabby, shameless and short-term measure which would do nothing to heal a social care system in crisis.
 
This vote marks the death knell of a cynical attempt to buy the votes of older people which would have led to cuts in social services for some of the most vulnerable.
 
Labour should be ashamed of its failure to deliver a fair long-term care system for elderly people.
 
We must now get on with the serious business of securing comprehensive reform. All the parties owe it to those in need of care to provide a fair and affordable solution.
