Brown misleading people on DNA database says Huhne

Fri, 09 Apr 2010

Only the Liberal Democrats can be relied on to protect the basic principle of innocent until proven guilty," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.

Commenting on Gordon Browns campaign appearance with the mother of Sally Anne Bowman and his comments on the retention of DNA profiles of people who are not convicted of crimes, Chris Huhne said:

It is deeply disappointing that Gordon Brown is using Sally Anne Bowmans terrible murder to mislead people about the DNA database.

It is completely right to check the DNA of those arrested against a database of unsolved crimes. It is completely wrong to hoard innocent peoples DNA for years on end.

Only the Liberal Democrats can be relied on to protect the basic principle of innocent until proven guilty.
