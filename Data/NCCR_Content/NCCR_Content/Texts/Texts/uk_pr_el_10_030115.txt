Press Release from Party: SNP

17.4 million jobs funding boost
Tue, 20/04/2010 - 17:33

Bob Doris MSP has welcomed todays announcement of the latest allocations by the Scottish Government of European Regional Development (ERDF) funding to support jobs creation and economic recovery.

17.4 million is to be invested in urban regeneration and rural development projects across Scotland, helping to create around 950 new jobs.

SNP MSP for Glasgow Mr Doris said:

This funding will be a huge boost for all the communities who will benefit from it.  The SNP government is targeting this money directly at job creation and economic recovery.

From Aberdeenshire to Dumfries and Galloway, these allocations will support a wide variety of projects that will create employment opportunities and support economic growth locally and in Scotland as a whole.

In the Glasgow area alone, more than 4 million will go to support projects in Bridgeton, Govan, the Merchant City and Rutherglen and will be a welcome boost for those communities.

In the north of Glasgow, for example, the 908,521 grant for the North Glasgow Regeneration Agencys Saracen Exchange project will deliver a new health hub, incorporating a health centre and dental centre, alongside a business and learning centre and offices for North Glasgow Housing Association. The whole development will act as a springboard for public health improvement, jobs creation and wider regeneration activity in the local area.

By investing in projects like these, which combine jobs, regeneration and essential local services, the SNP government is delivering lasting benefits to communities and prioritising economic recovery across Scotland.

ENDS
