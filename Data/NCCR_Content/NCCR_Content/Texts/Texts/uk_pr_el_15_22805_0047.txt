Green MPs will push Labour on Trident debate, says Natalie Bennett

9 April 2015

The leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett, has responded by an attack by the Conservative Party on Labour's policy on Trident nuclear weapons. 

Ms Bennett, whose party is standing in a record number of seats at this election, promised that Green MPs will push for a debate on Trident, and encourage MPs from all parties to vote against renewal.

Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, said: 

"This latest round of Tory speculation doesn't conceal the fact that the Labour Party is committed to renewing our multibillion pound nuclear weapons system. 

The truth is that the Labour leadership has made it clear that they will prioritise spending £100 billion on a cold war relic - rather than investing in the schools and hospitals that this country so desperately needs. 

Only one party is standing up to Trident across the UK. Green MPs will put pressure on the Government to ensure that a proper debate is had over Trident. 

With 3/4 of Labour candidates opposed to Trident (1), it's clear that internal pressure on the leadership isn't working - we need more Green voices in Parliament to give the Labour party a backbone on issues like Nuclear Weapons.'
