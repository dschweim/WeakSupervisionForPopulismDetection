Press Release from Party: SNP

Businesses snap up 7,000 apprentices
Wed, 28/04/2010 - 10:44
Anne McLaughlin MSP has welcomed an announcement
by Skills Minister Keith Brown today that Scottish businesses have
already signed up to employ more than 7,000 Modern Apprentices this
year.  

SNP MSP for Glasgow, Ms McLaughlin said: 

"It's extremely encouraging news that 7,000 young people and
adults will be able to start work this month as Modern Apprentices. The
Scottish Government exceeded its target to provide 20,000 Modern
Apprenticeships last year, and from today's announcement it looks like
this coming year will be another bumper one for apprentices.  

"This is vital investment by the SNP government, which will not
only build the skills and knowledge to drive Scotland's future success,
but also help to ease the human and social costs of recession.
Apprenticeships get young people leaving school and college into work
and provide adults who have lost their jobs during the economic downturn
with the opportunity to retrain, which is why the SNP has made it a
priority to provide more Modern Apprenticeship places in more sectors
than ever before."
