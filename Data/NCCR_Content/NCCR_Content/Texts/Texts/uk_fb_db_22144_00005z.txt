Text of the posting:
-------------
On Sunday I’ll be joining thousands on the streets of London as part of a global movement for climate justice that grows by the day. We’re holding governments to account – and we refuse to accept warm words when it’s urgent action that is required. 

We are under no illusion that there are huge vested interests at stake. The fossil fuel industry won’t change without a fight.

But alternatives to the old way of doing things are already flourishing. A renewable energy revolution has started: from solar panels on schools to community owned wind. The climate movement is diverse, and swelling: more businesses are embracing the circular economy, universities are divesting from fossil fuels and religious leaders are calling for urgent action. We can’t leave our future in the hands of those inside the secure zones at climate conferences.

Sunday’s demonstration will send a crucial message to the British government. They must be bold in the Paris climate talks and beyond – reversing the cuts to renewable power and putting citizens, not corporations, at the heart of our energy future.
