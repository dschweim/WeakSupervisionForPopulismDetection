UK Border Agency criticised by its own staff
Friday, April 9 2010

The UK Border Agency - responsible for securing Britains borders - is badly managed, poorly motivated and getting worse, according to a staff survey uncovered today.

"If the people whose job it is to control our borders dont think the Government is doing a good job on immigration then why should the rest of us?", said Chris Grayling, the Shadow Home Secretary.

The results, from the 2009 Civil Service People Survey, show that:

    Fewer than one in four staff think that the UK Border Agency (UKBA) is well managed. When asked whether the organisation was changing for the better, four out of five staff members disagreed.
    Only half of employees say they have the tools and information I need to do my job well. Most say that poor performers are allowed to get away with it, less than a third 'think management have a clear view of the future, and only one in four say that they are sufficiently motivated to do their job. As a final insult, only one in four say that they think the staff survey will make any difference to management at the Agency.
    Net immigration has tripled under Labour, and it is estimated that there are now around 700,000 illegal immigrants hiding out in Britain. The UKBA was set up by the Labour Government in 2008.

"The reality is that we have a Government that has presided over unsustainable levels of immigration and has completely failed to control our borders", Grayling added.

"A Conservative Government will introduce much tighter controls and will get net immigration back down to the levels of the 1990s  tens of thousands a year instead of the hundreds of thousands weve seen under Labour."
