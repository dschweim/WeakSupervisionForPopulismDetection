Party Manifesto: Green (uk) - National Elections 2010
-------------------------------------

farming, foodand animalprotection
Healthy and affordable foodand recreationWe would:• Localise the food chain, including assistancefor small farms, starting farmers’ markets,farm box schemes and locally owned co-ops.• Set new targets every five years and aminimum conversion of 10% of UK foodproduction to organic every five years.• Replace the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP) with support for smaller farms, organicagriculture, local food markets, and measuresto increase biodiversity in our countryside –European subsidies must support planetfriendlyfarming.
• Replace the Common Fisheries Policy(CFP) with policies that prioritise protectionof the oceans and provide sustainable supportto fishing communities. In particular, properlyfinance the implementation of the Marineand Coastal Access Act.• Support GM-free zones and continue towork for a complete ban on geneticallymodified food in Europe.• Intensive livestock farming is a majorcontributor to greenhouse gases through theproduction of methane.We will work tomeasure and reduce the impact of our meatand dairy consumption, while recognisingthat traditional rotational grazing haspotential for storing carbon in the soil.• Improve food skills by encouraging schoolsto involve children in growing, preparingand cooking food.• Reduce the dominance of supermarketchains through a range of measures, such as:- vigorously enforcing monopoly legislationagainst the existing largest chains;- introducing a supermarket Ombudsmanto protect farmers from supermarket bullying;- prohibiting new out-of-town retailing,and requiring parking charges for private carparks with exemption for the disabled;- insisting that 50% of retail floor space inall new developments is affordable space forlocal small businesses;- including clear policies on sustainabilityto enable planning authorities to give priorityto local firms and farms;- prohibiting new private retail parking inlarge developments, apart from disabled; and- providing many more allotments.Most people who want an allotment shouldbe able to get one. Councils should useexisting powers to designate new allotmentsin perpetuity.Taking animal protectionseriouslyWe share the world with other animals andare not entitled to ill-treat or exploit them.Accordingly we would:• Phase out all forms of factory farming ofanimals and enforce strict animal welfarestandards generally, including in organicagriculture.• Ensure that the European ban on sealimports is implemented fully; ban the importof real fur products, but ensure that real furis clearly labelled until a ban is in place;press the EU to ban fur factory farming;bring in non-lethal alternatives to shootingseals at fish farms.
• Maintain the ban on hunting with dogs andextend to other blood sports, including theuse of snares, and oppose badger culling.• Immediately ban causing harm toanimals (including but not only primates)in research, testing and education, and investin the development of alternatives to animalexperiments.• End live animal exports and limit journeytimes for all animal transport.• Implement a full ban on the productionand sale of eggs produced from hens kept inbattery cages (including ‘enriched’ cages).• Protect biodiversity and human andanimal health.We will always adopt the‘precautionary principle’ with regard toany alleged benefits of new technologiessuch as genetic modification, cloning,xenotransplantation and nanotechnology.• Regulate the companion animal tradeincluding a ban on the import of so-called‘exotic pets’.

Allotments – seeding the future330,000 people have allotments –and 100,000 are waiting for one.Allotments cut carbon and are seedsfor communities to grow. They also:1. Allow people to save money.2. Provide an area for abundant wildlife.3. Help to absorb carbon dioxide fromthe atmosphere.4. Help to cut the amount of carbondioxide in the world’s atmosphere:people grow their own food insteadof buying it all, thus reducing ‘air miles’(and shipping and lorry pollution).5. Provide people with a communitygroup to belong to and enjoy.6. Provide people with a space to exercisewhile doing something worthwhile.7. Promote resilience.
