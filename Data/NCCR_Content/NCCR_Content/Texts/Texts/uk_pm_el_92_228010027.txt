Party Manifesto: LD (uk) - National Elections 1992
-------------------------------------

Encouraging a Fit, Active and Healthy Society

Sport is important for the economic, social and health benefits which it can bring and for its ability to enhance community identity.

Liberal Democrats will:

    Create a UK Sports Commission to provide a voice for participants, spectators, and administrators. State Sports Councils will continue to receive their core funds from government but the Commission will raise and distribute additional resources for the promotion of the participation and excellence.
    Encourage sport across the community. We will encourage school to invest in sports facilities and open them up to sports clubs and share facilities and coaching resources with local schools. We will encourage local authorities to transform football grounds into multi-sport venues.
    Encourage individual and corporate sponsorship, review the role of the Foundation for Arts and Sport and reconsider the Conservatives' hasty proposal for a national lottery.
    Maintain Britain's leading role in the fight against drug abuse in sport, ensuring adequate funding for testing programmes and education campaigns directed at participants.
    Enhance safety in the provision of sports grounds. We will put the safety of spectators first in any legislation and make standards mandatory. We will take into account the size of grounds when setting safety standards. We will raise revenue for investment in safety by increasing levies on football pools and betting. We will require local authorities to include sports spectators on ground safety committees.
