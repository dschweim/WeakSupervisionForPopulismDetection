Truancy has rocketed under Labour says Laws

Thu, 25 Mar 2010

Its obvious that Labours top-down approach has failed. We need a more effective local approach involving parents, schools and the police," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Children, Schools and Families Secretary.

Commenting on todays Government truancy figures, David Laws said:

These figures are disgraceful. Despite Tony Blair promising to get a grip on this problem more than a decade ago, truancy levels have rocketed.

Its obvious that Labours top-down approach has failed.  We need a more effective local approach involving parents, schools and the police. 

The Liberal Democrats will give schools extra money to allow teachers to work with individual children and make sure that they are engaged in the classroom.
