Press Release from Party: BNP

Labour Has Lost Control of Tory Created Asylum Seeker Scandal
March 16, 2010

Less than a third of failed asylum seekers have been removed from Britain despite benefits paid to such people rocketing by a staggering 1,700 percent over the last five years.

Official figures reveal that although around 27,000 failed asylum seekers were ordered to leave Britain in 2008, fewer than 8,000 were actually removed.

It is reported that the cost of paying benefits to asylum rejects increased by 1,700 percent in just five years, confirming fears that Labour has lost whatever grip it may claim to have on the asylum system.

It remains an indisputable fact that although 26,832 removal notices were served by the Home Office on failed applicants in 2008, the last year for which complete figures are available, only 7,850 were actually enforced.

This shows a substantial decrease on the 12,200 removed in 2004.

The Labour Governments failure to remove these illegal immigrants is estimated to have cost the British taxpayer at least 73 million in benefit handouts alone, which is an increase of over 4 million on the 2004 figure.

Meanwhile, the cost to the NHS, law enforcement and the education system remain undisclosed.

The Tory Party, when last in government, changed the law to allow asylum seekers to remain in Britain on state benefits whilst awaiting the outcome of their taxpayer funded appeals.

To be precise, Section 8 of the Torys Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 gave asylum seekers: A right of appeal before a special adjudicator for all unsuccessful asylum applications before removal from the UK.

Meanwhile, as the equally corrupt Labour and Tory parties score cheap points off one another in the run-up to the general election, the British taxpayer is not only suffering daily from their folly but paying through the nose for the privilege.
