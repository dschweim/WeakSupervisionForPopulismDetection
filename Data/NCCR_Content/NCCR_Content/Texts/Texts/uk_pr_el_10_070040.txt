Press Release from Party: UKIP

Farage wins over the Buckingham pubs

Friday, 23rd April 2010

Nigel Farage, who is taking his Buckingham campaign to every pub in the constituency, has been featured in the Morning Advertiser  trade paper to the pub industry.

Speaking about his desire to rescue the ailing pub trade with a return to smoking rooms and a minimum pricing policy for supermarket alcohol, Nigel Farage told the Advertiser: I personally like pubs. Im a great fan of proper beer. What I like about pubs, apart from the beer, is the cross section of people you meet. I love the conversation, the banter.

My long-held theory is that every pubs a Parliament, that the real politics of this land are discussed in pubs. This current campaign is merely an extension of that.

Its a strong and long-held belief of mine that pubs matter; they matter in the sense of community and when they disappear the community loses something very special. Its not a tangible thing you can put a price on.

It fascinates me that our pubs are the envy of the world and are now being directly threatened. I want to fight, raise a voice and, if I can, to try and help.

And it seems the landlords and punters in Buckingham are falling in behind Nigels campaign to save the local pub trade and unseat Commons Speaker and incumbent MP John Bercow.

He is making an effort to speak to people, says one landlord. In my experience, Bercow isnt.
