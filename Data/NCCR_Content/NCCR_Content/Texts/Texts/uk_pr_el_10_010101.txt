Press Release from Party: LibDem

National Citizen Service is a multi-billion pound black hole says Alexander

Thu, 08 Apr 2010

In his desperation to gain the media spotlight David Cameron is lurching from one spending black hole to another," said Nick Cleggs Chief of Staff.

Commenting on Conservative plans for a National Citizen Service for 16- year-olds that would require billions in public funds, Danny Alexander, said:

The Conservatives are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think they can provide a National Citizen Service on the cheap.

Once again the Tories have made an enormous spending commitment without the foggiest idea of how theyre going to pay for it.

In his desperation to gain the media spotlight David Cameron is lurching from one spending black hole to another. Voters wont buy his claims that he can give them something for nothing.
