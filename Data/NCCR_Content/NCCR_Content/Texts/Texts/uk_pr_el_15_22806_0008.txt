The latest step towards a Northern Powerhouse economy
Post date: 18/03/2015

We’re backing our great cities of the North by investing in transport.

Creating a Northern Powerhouse of jobs and investment is a key part of our long-term economic plan to secure a better future for the whole country.

That’s why we’re rolling out our Northern Transport Strategy – to deliver a world-class transport system that helps businesses grow, attracts investment and creates jobs.

Our new strategy will:

    Reduce journey times, raise capacity and link up major northern cities with investment in high speed rail
    Develop new east-west road connections, including a road tunnel under the Peak District
    Introduce Oyster-style smart travel cards and simpler fares across the North

It’s another step towards a Northern Powerhouse economy – to make the most of the economic potential of the North, deliver more good jobs, and secure a better future for hardworking families.
