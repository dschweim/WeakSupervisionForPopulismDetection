David Cameron has spoken about the need to mend the broken society.

Speaking alongside anti-knife crime campaigner Brooke Kinsella, Cameron particularly addressed the issues of crime and violence that have so far largely been ignored by the other parties in this election campaign.

Brooke Kinsella has agreed to take on an ambassadorial role in a new Conservative Government for flagship youth mentoring and engagement projects in each of the hundred most deprived wards in England and Wales.

She would head a small panel of young people to work with the new Government in identifying the projects that should receive support, and also to establish a means of tracking their progress without imposing great bureaucracies upon them.

Cameron spoke about the tragic murders of people like Ben Kinsella, Rhys Jones, Gary Newlove, Sukhwinder Singh, Damilola Taylor and Jimmy Mizen.

"There is something about the frequency of these crimes, the depravity of these crimes, that betrays a deep and fundamental problem in Britain today", he said.

"As I have argued for many years now, these acts of murder and abuse are just the most violent and horrific expressions of what I have called the broken society."

Cameron went on to set out the progressive conservative approach to tackling these problems in our society. Criticising the Big Government approach, he said we need to "move from big government to the Big Society  a society with personal and collective responsibility right at its heart".

In moving to the Big Society, he went on to explain how a Conservative government would emphasise the principles of responsibility, common sense and people power.
