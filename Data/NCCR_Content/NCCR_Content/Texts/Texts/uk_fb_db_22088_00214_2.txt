Ofcom have just confirmed that UKIP is a major party and will, at a minimum, get two party election broadcasts. 

This confirms that UKIP is now a major party in British politics. Voters should now know that despite what all the other parties are going to tell them, the truth is self-evident: if you believe in Britain, and want to vote UKIP, you'll get a UKIP MP. It's great news.
