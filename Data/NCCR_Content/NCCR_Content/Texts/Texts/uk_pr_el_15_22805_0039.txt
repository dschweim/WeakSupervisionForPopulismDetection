Sturgeon Memo: Bennett and Harvie Respond

4 April 2015

Patrick Harvie MSP, co-convenor of the Scottish Green Party, and Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, have jointly backed Nicola Sturgeon's call for an inquiry into how the "Cameron" memo was leaked to the Telegraph.

Bennett and Harvie said: "The French Consul-General, the independent individual in this story, has said the memo is entirely incorrect and the topic of preferred prime minister was not discussed.

"That should put an end to claims about what Nicola Sturgeon said about David Cameron in the conversation - confirming as it does her denial of the original report.

"But it leaves open serious questions about the origins of this alleged leak. This is damaging to the reputation of our politically independent civil service and should be investigated as a matter of urgency."
