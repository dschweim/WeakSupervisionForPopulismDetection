Greens announce 60% tax rate for highest earners

12 April 2015
The Green Party has today announced plans to raise the top (additional) rate of income tax to 60%. 
 
The top rate of tax, which was lowered to 45% by the Coalition Government, only affects the top 1% of earners. 
 
The tax rise would be expected to raise approximately £2bn per year and act as a disincentive to companies paying excessively high salaries. 
Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party, said:
 
"For too long now the economy in this country has worked for those at the top, while failing everyone else. 
 
"The 60p tax will raise money to fund crucial public services, contributing towards the reversal of the failed policy of austerity that is making the poor, the disadvantaged and the young pay for the greed and fraud of the bankers.
 
"Only the Green Party are proposing radical changes which will redistribute wealth within our economy and encourage companies to reduce the gap between their highest- and lowest-earners."
