Press Release from Party: LibDem

Efficiency savings leading to cuts in NHS services says Lamb

Wed, 21 Apr 2010

Liberal Democrats will protect NHS services by putting local people in charge through elected health boards," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary.

Commenting on the Pulse report released today which reveals that Labours NHS efficiency savings are leading to cuts to frontline services, Norman Lamb said:

Despite Labour's claim that the NHS is being protected, it is quite clear that cutbacks to frontline services are already happening.

This type of panic budget slashing rarely improves services and nearly always costs more money in the long term.

The NHS does need to save money but we should start by cutting back on management, quangos and top-level pay, not cherished local services.

Liberal Democrats will protect NHS services by putting local people in charge through elected health boards.
