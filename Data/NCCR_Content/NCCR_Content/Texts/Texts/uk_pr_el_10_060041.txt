News story
Most children released from jail reoffend within a year
Thursday, April 8 2010

New research by the Conservative Party has shown that Labour have failed to stop a generation of children starting a life of crime.

"Labour have let down a whole generation of children. We cant go on like this, with Labour making our broken society worse by failing to stop reoffending", said Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling.

Sir Michael Caine spoke earlier today during the launch of the National Citizens Service about how we have got to save young people and give them a chance in society.

Research published today shows that:

    Three quarters of young people released from custody reoffend within a year. The number has barely moved since records began in 2000.
    Earlier this month Conservatives revealed that more than 150 children are now convicted of a crime every day, and that the number of criminal children has risen under Labour.
    Last week Gordon Brown boasted about the Governments record but these statistics show that reoffending rates among young people released from custody has hardly improved under Labour.

"People must choose between five more years of Gordon Browns tired government, or David Cameron and the Conservatives with the energy, leadership and values to cut crime and give children a better chance in life", Grayling added.
