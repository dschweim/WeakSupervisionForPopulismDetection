Press Release from Party: SNP

LibDems just London machine politicians
Wed, 14/04/2010 - 17:09

Commenting on the launch of the Liberal Democrats' London launch of their election manifesto this morning, before which its author Danny Alexander called for a so-called "needs-based" assessment of funding for Scotland - similar to the Tories' plans, which take no account of Scotland's revenues - SNP election campaign coordinator Stewart Hosie said:

"The Lib Dems try to pretend they are different from Labour and the Tories, but their policy statements give the game away. The reality is they are exactly the same as the other London parties when it comes to slashing Scotland's budget in a totally unfair and unjustified smash and grab raid.

"Danny Alexander wrote their manifesto, and he has now admitted that they are targeting Scotland's cash share in exactly the same way as the Tories and Labour.

"Labour threaten 'deeper and tougher' cuts than Thacher while the Tories promise a special 'Cameron Cut', to which we can now add the 'Clegg Cut' under the Lib Dems.

"And just as the Liberals are part of the cosy Westminster consensus on cuts, they are part of the tired, discredited Westminster machine which is failing communities across Scotland.

"Only SNP candidates promising to be local and national champions for their communities and for Scotland offer any real alternative at this election."

Note: Danny Alexander on BBC's Good Morning Scotland:

"We've always said that we think there should be needs-based assessment between the nations and regions of the UK. We've got to look at that again."
