    Comment on Tory childcare policy re-announcement

    Tristram Hunt, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, commenting on the Tory childcare policy re-announcement, said:

    “Another day, another unfunded policy that shows the depths of desperation within the Tory campaign. Hard working families will not be fooled by the £600 million gap in funding for this policy, as announced last week. It shows that David Cameron has no credible solutions to the problems facing working families.

    "Labour has a better plan, with an upfront, fully funded expansion of childcare for 3 and 4-year olds and a guarantee of access to childcare between 8am and 6pm for primary age children. We will make sure that the recovery reaches the homes of working people.”
