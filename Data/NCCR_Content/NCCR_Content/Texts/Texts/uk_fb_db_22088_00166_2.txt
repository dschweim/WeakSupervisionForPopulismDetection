No Mr Cameron, UKIP voters won't "come home" to either the Tories or Labour. Those parties abandoned what they stood for, and mocked and derided those who joined UKIP. But now there's an election you want these "fruit cakes and loons" back. Sorry Dave, they've found a new home. And it's somewhere they don't get routine abuse from their hosts.
