Labour taking Scotland for granted on unemployment says Carmichael

Wed, 17 Mar 2010

Only the Liberal Democrats will provide the investment in green jobs we need to get Scots back into work," said the Liberal Democrat Shadow Scotland Secretary.

Commenting on new figures which show Scottish unemployment is still rising while overall UK unemployment falls, Alistair Carmichael said:

The Governments claim that their action is making a difference clearly doesnt extend to Scotland.

Yet again it looks like Labour is taking Scotland for granted.

Only the Liberal Democrats will provide the investment in green jobs we need to get Scots back into work.
