15 April 2015

Membership of the Green Party of England and Wales has just passed 60,000 and membership of the combined UK Green parties is fast approaching 70,000 (1).

The Green Party, the fastest-growing political party in England and Wales, has seen its membership surge since the end of 2009, when the party had 9,630 members. 

Membership of the Green Party of England and Wales sky-rocketed by 123% in 2014 and continues to surge in 2015. Earlier this year membership of Green Party of England and Wales passed that of UKIP and the Liberal Democrats to make the Greens the third-largest party in England and Wales. At the end of 2013 membership stood at 13,809. 

A Green Party spokesperson said:

“We go in to this election powered by an unheralded level of grassroots activity from Green Party members and supporters.

“More and more people are motivated to join the Greens when they learn about our values and principles. People are fed up with our tired business as usual politics and unbalanced economy and looking for a real alternative. Only the Greens are committed to delivering the real change for the common good that people are crying out for.”
