Liberal Democrats call for end to child detention

Sat, 13 Mar 2010

Liberal Democrat Spring Conference today pledged its commitment to ending child detention in immigration centres.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary, Chris Huhne said:

It is a moral stain on this countrys proud reputation in accepting refugees that we are routinely locking up children for months at a time even though they have committed no crime.

Locking children up in this way can do them serious physical and psychological harm. This is the behaviour of the Victorian workhouses, not 21st century Britain.

The Government must find its long lost moral compass and put an end to child detention immediately.
