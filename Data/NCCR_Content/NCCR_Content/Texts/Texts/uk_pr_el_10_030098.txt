Press Release from Party: SNP

Labours jobs pledge cant be trusted
Sat, 17/04/2010 - 12:48

Commenting on Labours latest jobs pledge which has now magically gone
back up to 100,000 despite being 20,000 in their manifesto, Stewart
Hosie, the SNP's Westminster election campaign coordinator, said their
position on job creation was more elastic than a bungee rope.  

Commenting Mr Hosie said:  

Labours dissembling
in this campaign wont halt the decade of despair that they and the
Tories plan. Only by voting for SNP Champions can Scotland stop the cuts
threatened by Labour.  

However their jobs pledge is not only raising eyebrows but
is bouncing about like a bungee rope. At the budget they were saying
Labour would create 156,000 jobs. Last week Iain Gray was saying 100,000
skilled jobs over 5 years. Yet in their manifesto it dropped
substantially to 20,000. Now its back up to 100,000.  

Does Jim Murphy think people and the press are fools and wont
notice how he is just plucking figures out the air? Al he shows is how
no-one can trust a word Labour says.  

The rhetoric does
not also meet the reality. One of their Ministers has already admitted
that Labour will REDUCE employment like all the other London parties.  

Its time Labour in Scotland came clean about their plans in
this election. Its time they declared their support for Alistair
Darlings deeper and tougher cuts than Thatcher and how many jobs they
plan to cut.
