    Response on report into impact of LASPO Act on civil legal aid

    Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, responding on the Justice Select Committee report into the impact of the LASPO Act 2012 on civil legal aid, said:

    “Labour warned at the time that changes made by David Cameron’s Government would deprive thousands of people access to justice, yet Ministers pushed ahead regardless.

    “This damning report reveals that the damage is far worse than anyone at the time imagined. The crucial safety nets needed to catch the most vulnerable are simply non-existent, and there’s no evidence the Government’s policies have delivered value for money.”
