Conservative double standards on NHS says Norman Lamb

Mon, 12 Apr 2010

This is a complete double standard. Only last week David Cameron was happy to go campaigning in Kingston hospital, but suddenly the Conservatives are saying its unfair for parties to use the NHS in this way," the Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary said.

Commenting on the Conservative attack on Labour for using an NHS hospital to launch their manifesto, Norman Lamb, said:

This bizarre attack shows how little the Tories have to say about the big issues facing the country.

This is a complete double standard. Only last week David Cameron was happy to go campaigning in Kingston hospital, but suddenly the Conservatives are saying its unfair for parties to use the NHS in this way.

The pettiness of the Conservatives response is beyond belief. People will not be impressed with a party that has so little to say about Labours legacy of failure.

The real issue about Labours launch venue was the fact that it was at another PFI project steeped in debt.
