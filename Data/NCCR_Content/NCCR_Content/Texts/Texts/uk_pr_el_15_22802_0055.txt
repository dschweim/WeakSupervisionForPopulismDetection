    Great Western rail franchise - we need Labour’s better plan for the railways - Michael Dugher

    Michael Dugher MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, responding to the announcement of the new direct award the Department for Transport has agreed with FirstGroup to run the Great Western line, said:

    “In less than a week, Ministers have now rushed out two direct awards to private sector rail companies making a mockery of the current franchise model.

    “These last minute stitch-ups with the private train firms, rushed out the door before the election, epitomises the Tories’ disregard for passengers and its double standards. They had competition for the East Coast Main Line that excluded the public sector operator running the line from even bidding, yet they’re handing out a four-year deal to another private sector operator to run Great Western without any competition.

    “The current franchising system is not fit for purpose for either the travelling public or the taxpayer. That’s why we need Labour’s better plan for the railways that will put the current franchise system in the bin, create a public sector operator to take on these failing private firms and ensure a strong passenger voice within a more publicly controlled railways.

    “David Cameron’s devotion to the status quo on our railways leaves hard-pressed passengers having to endure rip-off fares and worsening services.”
