Press Release from Party: SNP

Scots positive about balanced parliament
Thu, 29/04/2010 - 11:42

Details of a poll by YouGov shows that Scotland is the only part
of the UK which is positive about the prospect of a balanced parliament
compared to all other parts of the UK and the UK as a whole.  
  
The
figures show that 49% of Scots think a balanced parliament is a good
thing compared to 40% who dont  a 9% lead. This compared to 37% for
and 47% against in the UK as a whole  a deficit of -10%.  

Commenting the SNP's election co-ordinator Stewart Hosie said:  
  

These figures show that Scots voters know the potential of a
balanced parliament to deliver for their communities.   
  
This
election is moving ever closer in Scotlands direction and the London
partys panic and confusion simply proves the potential for Scotland to
win concessions in a balanced parliament.  

Over the last three years the SNP has successfully passed three
budgets with support from different parties, and delivered the
beginnings of recovery from a recession that has been shorter in
Scotland than in England.  

Parties have worked together to promote and protect
apprenticeship places, tax bonuses for small businesses and more police
on our streets.  
  
"Scaremongering over a balanced parliament
has a hollow ring in Scotland and this poll shows Scots voters want to
see the same success at Westminster and know the only way to deliver a
balanced parliament for  Scotland is with a vote for local and national
champions with the SNP.
