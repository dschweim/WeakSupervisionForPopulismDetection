Press Release from Party: LibDem

Tory immigration policy worst of both worlds says Huhne

Tue, 16 Mar 2010

The Liberal Democrats will today call for tougher immigration control in densely populated areas like London and the South East while allowing more migrants elsewhere.

In a keynote speech to Policy Exchange today, Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary, Chris Huhne will say that an overall national limit of the sort proposed by the Tories would be too lax in London and the South East and too tough in Scotland.

Commenting, Chris Huhne said:

Immigration is vital to our economy but lots of people are worried by the issue because of Labours catastrophic mismanagement of the system.

If we are to make the case for a liberal immigration policy, we have to give the public confidence that the flow is properly managed and the pace of change is reasonable.

The Liberal Democrats are the only party offering a hard-headed assessment of the needs of different regions and parts of the economy.

We need a system that makes migrants go to those areas that most need them.

The Tory policy of pulling up the drawbridge because we have reached an arbitrary national limit would bring in the worst of all worlds.

Immigrants would continue to crowd into the most populous parts of the country  making the policy too lax for the South East of England and too tight for Scotland.
