Press Release from Party: LibDem

Takeover rules must change to prevent damaging free-for-all: Vince Cable

Sat, 10 Apr 2010

The Government removed this provision in 2002 and were now seeing the damage done by opening up a complete free-for-all," the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor said.

Commenting on reports that Labours election manifesto will include plans to restrict takeovers of British firms on public interest grounds, Vince Cable said:

The Liberal Democrats have been proposing a public interest test for some time.

It shouldnt be nationalistic. The issue is not whether there is a foreign bidder, its about whether its in the interests of the British economy.

The Government removed this provision in 2002 and were now seeing the damage done by opening up a complete free-for-all.

We need to protect firms from takeovers forced through by hedge funds for short-term profit thats not in the long-term interests of the British economy.
