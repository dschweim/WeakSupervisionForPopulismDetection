Busy day today. At Tech City to speak to digital businesses then jumping on a train to Peterborough, Sherwood and Dewsbury before meeting and CLP with Normanton, Pontefract & Castleford CLP members this evening. Looking forward to catching up with Losa Forbes, Leonie Mathers for Sherwood and of course the brilliant Paula Sherriff - Fighting for Dewsbury.
